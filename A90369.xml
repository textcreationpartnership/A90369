            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his very much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Friend and Kinſman, NEVILLE CATELINE Eſquire.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My deareſt Coſen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Ever looked upon that friendſhip which you have been pleaſed to afford me, as a very conſiderable part of my Happineſs, and have made it my buſineſs to finde out ſome way, whereby I might manifeſt my deſire of expreſſing my Obligations to you, which I cannot do more publickly than I do now.
<pb facs="tcp:115385:4"/>
Hereby alſo making as many, as ſhall vouchſafe to read this, Witneſſes of that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and unfeigned affection I bear you.</p>
            <p>This is the only end of the preſent addreſs, and not the leaſt hopes I have fancied to my ſelf, that the Book will find a more candid reception; or any deſire to put you to the trouble of defending it where you come. No, theſe Conſiderations are as far from my thoughts, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are common to moſt men, upon the like occaſion.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, give
<pb facs="tcp:115385:4"/>
me leave to tell you what I have many times thought of ſuch, as promiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the high and ſplendid names they prefix before their writings, to acquire I know not what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or at leaſt Protection: That they are like thoſe ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people of <hi>Arcadia</hi> (I think) that preſumed if they could once attain the top of a certain high Mountain, they might with eaſe touch the Moon; but when they had with a great deal of pains reached the top of it, how much they fell ſhort of their
<pb facs="tcp:115385:5"/>
aime, is eaſie to gueſs. For my part, I could never yet perceive, that any Book fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the better for his ſake, to whom it was Dedicated, no more then thoſe ſhips that having painted upon them the glorious Image and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of ſome Deitie, were notwithſtanding torn by common tempeſts, and made the ſport of every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wave.</p>
            <q>— Et pictos verberat unda Deos.</q>
            <p>For the ſecond, I ſhould be very unjuſt, to expect that at your hands, which I am ſo far from doing my ſelf, that
<pb facs="tcp:115385:5"/>
if I ſhould hear any vilifie and condemn it as poor and low, I ſhould, if no worſe, at leaſtwiſe readily aſſent to what they ſay; ſo mean a conceit have I of ought that is mine. For, Tranſlations at the beſt (as 'tis commonly, but well, ſaid) are but the wrong ſide of a ſute of hangings, which, though the ſtuffe be never ſo rich, and the workmanſhip artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, looks but untowardly. I do not therefore invite any to read this Tranſlation, but adviſe them rather, both for their own ſakes, and for the Authors,
<pb facs="tcp:115385:6"/>
whom I do very much honour, to read it in the French, as it came from the moſt accurate hand of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>PELLISSON.</hi> But if they can neither procure that, (as I think they will hardly), nor (if they do) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, they may make uſe of this which I offer them. If notwithſtanding all this, any ſhall ſcorn it becauſe a Tranſlation, I ſhall give them their liberty, ſo they will allow me mine, to ſay (which is all I am likely to bring, in my own defence) that <hi>Volentibus, non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentibus, tranſtuli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:115385:6"/>For the Book it ſelf, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from it the coorſe Engliſh habit I have given it, I ſuppoſe it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to any, that care to know what is done abroad in the world. I do not mean of the routing of Armies, and ſacking of Towns, which indeed looke beſt at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and when the Scene is laid in forreign Countries, (for our own has more then ſatisfied us with ſuch cruel delights) but of Learning and Learned men; an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after whom is a pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, if not laudable curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
<pb facs="tcp:115385:7"/>
I am ſure 'tis pleaſant: For, to inſtance in the preſent work, What greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment can be imagined then to ſee the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of ſo Famous a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, even from its Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Budding in a few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Friends, unto its full growth and maturitie, when eſtabliſhed in a Body, to the number of fourty, and thoſe all eminent Perſons, either in Church or State, or at leaſt in the Common-wealth of Learning? Can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to know their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
<pb facs="tcp:115385:7"/>
to hear their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and in ſome degree to enjoy the converſation of ſo many ingenious Spirits, ſuch as Monſieur <hi>de Balzac de Gomberville,</hi> (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Polexander</hi>) and <hi>de Scudery:</hi> Whom I the rather mention for that their Names are ſo well known among us, by their works that are done into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I treſpaſſe too much, and am afraid, leaſt this Pleaſure, which ſo much tranſports me, ſeem

            <p>I Reſolve, ſince you will have it ſo, to write all that I have been able to learn concerning the <hi>French Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> which is a Company that many talk of, and but few know, as it deſerves to be known. For whether we look upon its <hi>end,</hi> which was to advance the Tongue we ſpeak, to its higheſt perfection, and to chalk us out a way to attaine the height of Eloquence; or whether we conſider the <hi>perſons of whom</hi> it was <hi>compoſed,</hi> whoſe names are famous, and very likely will be ſo hereafter; or whether we caſt our eyes upon its <hi>Founder,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal</hi> de <hi>Richelieu,</hi> that famous Miniſter of State, whoſe Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and Fortune hath been alike extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; I ſee nothing in all this, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be known, and to have the

               <head>The firſt part. Of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Academie</head>
               <p>THE FRENCH Academie was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the Kings edict, till the yeare 1635. But we may ſay that its origine was foure or five yeares elder,<note place="margin">Mr. Naudé in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue de maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curat, where he cites, <hi>Giou Bapt.

               <p>They that have written of the Accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the <hi>Humorists</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſay that is ſprung up by chance at the wedding of <hi>Lorenzo Maucini,</hi> a Gentle man of Rome, that divers perſons of qualitie among the gueſts, to give ſome divertiſement to the Ladies, and becauſe twas the time of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval,</hi> ſet themſelves at firſt <hi>extempore,</hi> &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwards with a little premeditation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſome ſonnets, comedies, &amp; diſcourſes, which gave them the name of <hi>Bellihumori:</hi> That afterwards taking an affection inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y to theſe exerciſes, they reſolved to form an Academie of good literature: That then they changed the name of <hi>Belli humori</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115385:12"/>
that of <hi>Humoriſti,</hi> and choſe for their <hi>deviſe,</hi> a Cloud, which being formed of ſalt exhalations from the Sea, falls down again in a ſweet and gentle ſhoure, with that of the Poet <hi>Lucretius,</hi> for the Motto, <hi>Redit agmine dulci.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The French Academie did not ariſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from an accidentall meeting, as that did. But certaine it is, that thoſe which began it ſcarce thought of any thing leſſe then that which happened afterward. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1629. ſome Gentlemen lodging in ſeverall places of <hi>Paris,</hi> and finding nothing more incommodious in that City, then to go many times to ſeek one another and all in vain took a reſolution to meet together one day in a week, at ſome one of their lodgings. They were all perſons of Learning &amp; of Extraordinary merit Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>au</hi> now <hi>Bp of Graſſe,</hi> who then was not a Churchman, <hi>Mounſieur de Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauld, Monſieur Chapelain, Monſieur Conrart, Monſieur Giry,</hi> the late <hi>Monſieur Habert</hi> Commiſſarie of the Artillerie <hi>Monſieur</hi> the <hi>Abbot of Ceriſy,</hi> his brother, <hi>Monſieur de Serizay,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leville.</hi> They mett at <hi>Monſieur Conrarts,</hi> whoſe lodgings were the moſt commodious to receive them, and in the heart of the Citty, from whence all the reſt were almoſt equally diſtant. There they entertained themſelves very familiarly, as it is uſuall in an ordinary viſit, with all kind of things, affairs, news, and good learning. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115385:12"/>
if any of the Company had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed any Work, as it often happened, he communicated it voluntarily to the reſt, who freely told him their opinions. Their conferences were concluded ſometimes, with a walk, and ſometimes with a collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus they continued three or four yeares, and as I have heard divers of them ſay, with extream pleaſure, and incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage. In ſo much as even at this day when they talke of thoſe times, and of the firſt age of the Academie, they ſpeak of it as of a golden age: during which, withal the innocency and all the liberty of the primitive times, without noiſe and without pomp, and without any other laws then thoſe of Friendſhip; they enjoyed whatſoever an ingenious Society and a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal life has either ſweet or charming.</p>
               <p>They had made an order not to ſpeake of it to any body, which was very exactly obſerved for a time. The firſt that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, was <hi>Monſieur de Malleville</hi> (for tis no hurt to accuſe him of a fault which the happineſſe of the event has excurſed) He had ſaid ſomething of it to <hi>Monſieur Faret,</hi> who had then newly printed his <hi>Honeſte-Homme;</hi> and who having obtained Leave to be at one of their conferences, brought with him a Copie of his Book which he gave them. He returned with very much Satifaction, as well with their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they gave of his book, as with all that paſſ't in the reſt of the converſation.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115385:13"/>
But as 'tis a hard matter, that a ſecret to which we have once given vent, ſhould not ſoon after become publick, and that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be more faithfull to us then we have been to our ſelves: Monſieur <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mareſts</hi> and Monſieur de <hi>Boiſrobert</hi> knew of theſe meetings, by meanes of Mr. <hi>Faret,</hi> Mr. <hi>Deſmarets</hi> came thither ſeverall times, and read there the fifth Volume of <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which he then compoſed. Mr. <hi>de Bois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robert</hi> deſired alſo to be preſent at them, and there was no colour in the world to deny him admittance, for beſides that he was a friend to moſt of theſe Gentlemen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his fortune procured him ſome reſpect, and rendered him the more conſiderable. He then was admitted, and when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in what manner works were there examined, and that it was not a buſineſſe of complements and flattteries, where each one commends that he might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, but that they did boldly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cenſure even the leaſt faults, he was fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with joy and admiration. He was then in his greateſt favour with the <hi>Cardinal de Richelieu,</hi> and his chiefeſt care was to recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are the ſpirits of his Maſter, after the noiſe &amp; perplexties of buſines, as well by pleaſant ſtories, at which he was the beſt of any man in the world, as in telling him all the pretty news of the Court and Town: and this divertiſement was ſo uſefull to the Cardinal, that his Cheif Phyſitian <hi>Monſieur Citois,</hi> was wont to ſay to him, <hi>My Lord,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115385:13"/>
wee'll do all we can for your health; but all our drugs are worth nothing, unleſſe you add thereto a little of Boiſrobert.</hi> Amongſt theſe familiar diſcourſes, Mr. <hi>de Boiſrobert,</hi> who entained him with all kind of news, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not to make an advantageous reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to him of the little Aſſembly he had ſeen, and of the perſons which compoſed it: and the Cardinall who had a ſoul na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally carryed unto great things, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above all the French tongue, in which he himſelf wrote exceeding well, after he had commended the deſign, he asked <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Boiſrobert,</hi> whether theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would make a ſocietie and aſſemble regularly and under publicke authoritie. <hi>Monſieur de Boiſrobert</hi> having anſwer'd that in his opinion this propoſition would be received with joy, he commanded him to make it, and to offer to theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men his protection for their Company, which he would get eſtabliſhed by Letters Patents, and his affection to each of them in particular, which he would manifeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all opportunities.</p>
               <p>When theſe offers had been made, and the queſtion was to reſolve in particular, what anſwer they ſhould return, there was ſcarce any of theſe Gentlemen which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs'd not a diſpleaſure, and a regret, that the honour which was done them would diſturbe the ſweetneſſe, and the familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their conferences: nay ſome of them and eſpecially, Monſieur <hi>de Soriſay,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115385:14"/>
Monſieur <hi>de malleville</hi> were of opinion that they ſhould excuſe themſelves to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal the beſt they could: but theſe two, beſides the generall reaſons that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them with the reſt, had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar one which they had an eye to. <hi>Monſieur de Seriſay</hi> was Controller of the houſe of the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucant,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de Malleville</hi> was Secretary to the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall de Baſſompierre;</hi> Theſe two Lords were lookt upon as Enemies to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, The firſt perceiving himſelf in no good condition at Court, had retired to his Government of <hi>Poitou,</hi> and the other was already a Priſoner in the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> Now you know in what reputation the Cardinal then was. One might think, that ſeeing himſelfe in a place ſo envy'd, and ſo expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the plots of the Grandees, there was ſcarſe any place, where he had not his Scouts to give him notice of all their deſignes.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Gentlemen then, feared leſt that this commerce which they ſhould have with him by meanes of an Academie, which he was to be Founder and Protector of, ſhould give men occaſion to talke, and render them ſuſpected to their Lords. They omitted not therefore any thing which might perſwade the company to be of their minds. However at laſt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion paſſed, which was <hi>Monſieur Chapelain's:</hi> for as he had neither paſſion nor intereſt againſt the Cardinal, who had taken notice of him, and, as a teſtimony of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115385:14"/>
the eſteem he had of him, had given him a Penſion; He repreſents unto them that it muſt be confeſt, they could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that their conferences had not been thus divulged, but that conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition things were in, it was not free for them to take which of the two parts they liked beſt. That they had to do with a Man, who is extreme eager in what he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and that is not accuſtomed to meet with oppoſition; or, if he does, to ſuffer it unpuniſht: That he might take it for an affront, if they ſhould refuſe his protection and might revenge himſelfe for it, upon each of them in particular: That at leaſt ſince that by the Lawes of the Realme, all kind of Aſſemblyes were forbidden that are made without authority from the Prince, he might if he pleaſed with a words ſpeaking, put an end to this in ſpite of them and by this meanes break up a Society, which there wa none of them, but wiſh't might be eternall. Upon theſe reaſons it was reſolved <hi>that Monſieur de Boiſrobert ſhould be deſired to returne moſt humble thanks to the Cardinal for the honour he did them, and to aſſure him that although they never had any ſuch ambitious thoughts, and were extreamly ſurprized with his Eminence deſigne, yet they were wholly reſolved to obey his Commands.</hi> The Cardinal received their anſwer with great ſatisfaction, and giving divers teſtimonies that he was very ſerious in this eſtabliſhment, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115385:15"/>
Monſier <hi>de Boiſrobert</hi> to tell them that they ſhould meet together as they were wont, and that they ſhould augment their company as they ſhould think fit, and that they ſhould adviſe among themſelves what forme and what Lawes it would be beſt to give it for the future.</p>
               <p>Things paſſed thus in the beginning of the yeare 1634. At the ſame time <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Conrart,</hi> at whoſe houſe they had their meetings hitherto, was about to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; having then invited all theſe Gentlemen as his particular friends to be at his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they conceived that for the future his houſewould not be ſo proper for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as before. Therefore they began to meet at Monſieur <hi>Deſmareſts,</hi> &amp; to think ſeriouſly, according to the intention of the Cardinal, concerning the eſtabliſhment of the Academie.</p>
               <p>IF you remember that you have read in ſome one of the Poets, the deſcription of a young Commonwealth, where ſome are buſied in making laws, and creating Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, others in ſetting out the ground, and drawing a platforme of the houſes; theſe in getting together materialls, and thoſe in laying the foundations for the Temples and Walls: Imagine that it was juſt ſo, in this firſt Inſtitution of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie, and that there paſſed divers things almoſt at the ſame time, which cannot be related but one after another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:115385:15"/>One of the firſt was, that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men increas'd their company with divers perſons conſiderable for their merit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom there were ſome that were otherwiſe ſo for their quality. For, as the Court does alwaies zealouſly imitate the inclinations of the grand Miniſters and Favorites eſpecially when they are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon reaſon and honeſty; Thoſe which were neere the Cardinal, and that were in any reputation of wit, thought it a peice of honour to be of that body of which he was the Protector and Father. Not only Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Deſmareſts,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Boiſrobert,</hi> who were the firſt that knew of theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate aſſemblies; but alſo Monſieur <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> Maſter of requeſts Monſieur <hi>de Chaſtelet</hi> Counſellor of State, (who was in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) Monſieur <hi>Serrien</hi> then Secretary of Eſtate, and Monſieur <hi>Seguier</hi> Keeper of the Seales, now Chancellor of France, deſired to be of this Company. But becauſe I muſt in another place ſpeak of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademiciens in particular, I ſhall deferre till then to let you know, when and upon what occaſion each of them was admitted.</p>
               <p>And that they might give ſome order and forme to their Aſſembly, they reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to create forthwith their Officers: A <hi>Director</hi> and a <hi>Chanceller</hi> that ſhould be changed from time to time, and a <hi>Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that ſhould be perpetuall; the two firſt by lot, and the laſt by the ſuffrages of the Aſſembly. The Director was Monſieur
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115385:16"/>
                  <hi>de Serizay,</hi> the Chancellor Monſieur <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mareſts,</hi> the Secretary Monſieur <hi>Conrart,</hi> to whom this Office was given in his abſence by a common conſent, all agreeing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that no man could better fill this place. Then began he to ſet down in writing what paſſ'd in the Aſſemblie, and to keepe thoſe Regiſters, from whence I have drawn the beſt and greateſt part of this Relation. They begin March 13. 1634.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe three Officers, they creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Stationer to the Academie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Regiſter. 13. March. 1634.</note> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſerve as <hi>dorekeeper</hi> to it. This charge was given to <hi>Camuſat,</hi> who of all others was eſteemed the moſt able,<note place="margin">Regiſter Apill. 10. 1634.</note> for beſides that he was very well ſeene in his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was a man of a good judgment, and would not print any ſcurvy books, ſo that when you and I came abroad into the world, and began firſt to reade French Pieces, 'twas almoſt an infallible marke of good ones, that he printed them.</p>
               <p>They conſulted likewiſe in theſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,<note place="margin">Reg.

               <p>But perhaps I ſhall one day, elſewhere and in a diſcourſe by it ſelfe, treate of all theſe Academies, and their names; To
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115385:17"/>
returne at preſent to that which I began to ſpeak of. At the ſame time that it choſe its name, it deliberated alſo concerning the Imployment it would have, and the Lavvs it ſhould eſtabliſh. All the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miciens were order'd to think of it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, Monſieur <hi>Faret</hi> was charged in the meane time to make a diſcourſe, which ſhould conteine as 'twere the Project of the Academie, and which might ſerve for a preface to its Statutes: and Monſieur <hi>de Serizay,</hi> to frame a letter to the Cardinal, to beſeech him to honour the company with his Protection. 'Twas by this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by this Project, that they began. The letter vvhich is of the 22th of March,<note place="margin">The Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Letter March, 22, 1634</note> 1634. contained in effect thus much, <hi>That if Monſieur the Cardinal had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh't his writings, there would want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the perfection of the Tongue, and that queſtionleſſe he would have done that which the Academie propounds to it ſelfe to do: but that his modeſty forbidding him to ſet forth his own rare peices, did not alſo hinder him from approving that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſearcht after thoſe treaſures which he keeps locked up, and from authorizing their ſearch. That this was the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid foundation of the Academies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and of its project, which ſhould be preſented to his eminence with this letter by Meſſieurs de Bautru, du Chaſtelet, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115385:17"/>
de Boiſrobert: That it would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive life but from him, and that the hope of his protection oblig'd it already to an extreame reſentment.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Project of the Academie</note> The Project was a diſcourſe very large, full of many excellent paſſages, which may be reduced in a leſſer compaſſe to theſe heads: <hi>That the Countrey we inhabite hath alwaies bred moſt valiant men, but that their valour hath beene without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in compariſon with that of the Romans and Greeks, becauſe they never had the act of rendring it illuſtrious by their writings. That nevertheleſſe at this day the Greeks and the Romans being become ſlaves to other Nations, and their very languages, though ſo rich and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, being reckoned amongſt the dead; it fell out happily for Frauce that we have continued not only in poſſeſſion of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of our Anceſtors, but alſo in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to raiſe againe to life, Eloquence, which ſeemed to be buryed with thoſe, that were the inventors and Maſters of it: That after the great and memorable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the King, 'twas a moſt happy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that there are found at this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his ſubjects ſo many men able to make that be read with delight, which we have ſeen done with aſtoniſhment.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115385:18"/>
That alſo 'twas none of the leaſt thoughts of that great Cardinal his prime Miniſter to take on him as he does the protection of Learning, ſo neceſſary for the good and glory of the State, and to cauſe it to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by his favour and approbation. That there ſeemed to want nothing elſe to the felicity of the Kingdom, but to ſeparate from the number of barbarous languages that Tongue which we ſpeak, and which all our neighbours too will ſpeak erelong, if our conqueſts continue as they have begun: That for ſo brave a deſigne, he thought fit to aſſemble a certaine number of perſons able to ſecond his Intentions. That theſe Conferences are one of the moſt aſſured meanes to bring it about. That our tongue which is already more perfect than any other that is ſpoken at this day, may as well at length ſucceed the Latine, as the Latine did the Greek, if there were more care taken then hath been hitherto of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, which is not indeed the whole of eloquence, but makes a very conſiderable part thereof.</hi> After this was added. <hi>That as for the order, practice, and lawes, of his Aſſembly, 'twas thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into a Statute apart, and in this place to treat only of two things, which would be too much forc'd and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115385:18"/>
in that brevity which is proper to the ſtile of Lawes. The firſt, of the qualities requiſite in thoſe who ſhould be truſted in this buſineſſe; and the ſecond, What ſhould be their Functions, and what kind of matters they ſhould handle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For the firſt, That it is not enough to have a large and profound knowledge in the Sciences, nor a facility to ſpeak handſomly in converſation, nor a lively and prompt imagination, good as inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But that there muſt be at 'twere a particular Genius, and a naturall light able to judge of that which is moſt neat and profound in Eloquence: That laſtly there is requiſite a certain mixture of all theſe other qualities in one equall temper ſubjected to the Laws of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to a ſolid judgment. As for their Functions, which was the ſecond thing they promiſed to treat of: That they ſhould be, The purifying of the language from the filth it hath contracted, either in the mouth of the vulgar, or in the croud of Lawyers, or in the impunities of wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or by the ill uſe of ignorant Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or by the abuſe of thoſe who corrupt it in writing, or of thoſe that in the Pulpits ſpeak indeed what they ought, but not as they ought. That to this end 'twere good
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115385:19"/>
to ſettle a certain conſtant uſe of words: That 'twere fit to retaine ſome of thoſe which are now in uſe, ſo that they be refer'd to one of the three kinds of writings, in which they might be uſed; that thoſe, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which are naught in a lofty, might be borne with in a mean, and approved in the loweſt and Comique ſtyle. That one of the meanes which the Academiciens would make uſe of, to attain unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be the examination and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their own writings. That they would ſeverely examine the Subject and the manner of handling it, the Arguments, the Style, the Numbers, and every word in particular. That after ſo exact obſervations, they would give any one that would take the paines, leave to add his, perhaps with as ridiculous a ſucceſſe, as thoſe that thought they had found ſpots in the Sun. That alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademie deſired to pleaſe none but the wiſeſt men, and not thoſe fooles that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be dazeld with the glory which it receives from ſo great a protector. That if theſe reſolutions may not ſerve as rules for the future, they may at leaſt ſerve as advice, ſince tis not probable that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men aſſembled together ſhould not be able to decide things, in which it cannot
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115385:19"/>
be denyed but they have manifeſted ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent experience. That this Company hath taken the name of the FRENCH ACA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEMIE, becauſe twas the moſt modeſt and moſt proper to its Function. That for the Seale it would uſe, and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it would enjoy, it referred it ſelf therein to its Founder, and to his Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who alone having given forme to this Inſtitution was able to build it up upon foundation ſtrongs enough to continue as long as the Monarchie.</hi>

               <p>This <hi>Project</hi> accompany'd with the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which I told you of, was preſented to the Cardinall by the 3. deputies of the Company. He cauſed the Letter to be read to him twice, once by Cardinall <hi>de la Valette,</hi> who then was with him; and the 2d. time by Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert.</hi> He anſwered the Deputies in theſe very termes, as I find them in the Regiſter.<note place="margin">Reg.

                  <hi>That he had a good esteem of the whole Company in generall, and each member thereof in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. That he was very well pleaſed with their deſiring his Protection, &amp; that he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to them with all his heart.</hi> He cauſed the <hi>Project</hi> alſo to be read to him, and Marked in it ſome paſſages which he thought were to be corrected, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to approve it, when 'twas mended; which being told the Company, they gave in charge firſt to Monſieur <hi>Chapelain, Godeau,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115385:20"/>
Habert</hi> and <hi>Deſmareſts</hi> to Examine the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.<note place="margin">Reg. May 1. 1634.</note> At laſt, ſince each of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiciens found fault with ſome thing or other in it, twas reſolved that every one of them ſhould examine it by themſelves, and to this purpoſe that there ſhould be thirty copies of it printed,<note place="margin">Reg. May 8. 1634.</note> to be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt them, but that they ſhould ſwear not to ſpeake of it, or ſhew it to any body. I learnt afterwards one thing which I account very remarkable, twas, that to have theſe thirty Copies they took the way of printing, not onely becauſe they judged it the moſt facile and ready way, but alſo becauſe according to the Common opinion, the leſſer pains the Eyes take in reading a book, the more liberty the minde hath to judge of it. That one ſees more clearly &amp; obſerves better the graces &amp; the faults of a work, when tis written in a good Character, then when in an ill; and better yet, when tis printed then when tis written. That for Inſtance <hi>Cardinall Perron,</hi> who ſpared neither paines, nor care, nor coſts for his books, made them alwayes be printed twice: firſt to diſtribute onely ſome Copies of them to his private friends, on which they might make their obſervations: and Secondly, to publiſh them to the world in that forme which he reſolved to ſet them forth in. And to the end that none of this firſt ſort ſhould be divulged againſt his will, he cauſed them to be wrought off at his own houſe at <hi>Bagnolet,</hi> where he had a Preſſe on purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:115385:20"/>Well,<note place="margin">Reg: May 18 1634.</note> the thirty printed copies were brought back by the Academiciens with their Notes, and which is conſiderable in ſo great a number, there was not one of them that had divulged the ſecret. The diſcourſe was examined afterwards with great care in ſeverall Aſſemblies, whereof many were extraordinary for this very buſineſſe. At laſt,<note place="margin">Reg. June 19. July 17. Octob. 30. 1634.</note> Monſieur <hi>Faret</hi> made it ready to be preſented a ſecond time to the Cardinal; which he and Monſieur <hi>de Bioſrobert</hi> had charge to do. The Cardinall received the Copy which they preſented him, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing approved it for the matter, ſent it back ſoon after to the Company with his own marginall caſtigations, written by the hand of <hi>Charpentier</hi> his Secretary, which related onely to the forme and expreſſions of it.

               <p>As for the Statutes of the Academy,<note place="margin">Reg. March 27. 1634.</note> the firſt that travaild in this ſubject by order of the Company was Monſieur <hi>de Chaſtelet</hi>

Tis, that he propounded <hi>that each of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miciens ſhould be bound to compoſe every year a piece great or ſmall, in the praiſe of God.</hi> The other, which ſeems to me very ſtrange, though it was deſired by Monſieur Sirmond, a man otherwiſe of a very ſolid judgment, <hi>Twas, that he would have all the Academici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens bound by oath, to uſe thoſe words which were approved by the Major part of voyces in the Aſſembly.</hi> So that if this Law had been received, whatſoever particular aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, one might have to a word, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he muſt of neceſſity make uſe of it &amp; if any one ſhould uſe it otherwiſe, he would commit not onely a fault, but a ſin. All theſe memoires were put into the hand of 4. Commiſioners Meſſeurs <hi>du Chaſtelet

               </p>
               <p>The ſame Monſieur Conrart had alſo in Charge to draw up the Letters Parents for the Foundation of the Academie, which ſeemed to belong unto him upon a double account, becauſe he was both Secretary to the Academie, and Secretary to the King. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had read them in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, Meſſieurs <hi>du Chaſtelet, de Serizay</hi> and <hi>de Ceriſy</hi> were ordered to receive them with him,<note place="margin">Reg. January 2. 1635.</note> and to ſhew them to the Lord keeper of the Seales; and Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert,</hi> to the Cardinall. I believe you'l take it kindly, that I have here inſerted them at large, ſince that they ſerve for the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the reſt, and that beſides they are conceived in very pure and Elegant terms, which not omiting thoſe clauſes and formes of Speech uſuall to the Chancerie do Nevertheleſſe relliſh the politeneſſe of the Academy and the Court.</p>

The troubles raiſed ſo often in the greateſt part of our Provinces, and the aſsiſtance which we have been obliged to give to divers of our Allies, have diverted us from the injoyment of that quiet, which we have procured for others. But as all our intentions have been juſt, ſo have they alſo ſucceeded proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly.

Wherefore having made known unto him our Intention, he hath repreſented unto us, that 'twas one of the moſt glorious marks of the felicity of a State; that Arts &amp; Sciences have flouriſht in it, &amp; that as well learning as armes have been there in honour and eſteem, ſince that they are one of the principall inſtruments of Vertue.

ever to attaine it, conſidering the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons which have a particular knowledge of the advantage, that it is Miſtris of, and of thoſe which may ſtill be added to it.

               <p>There had been added to the other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and tis likely it would have been eaſily obtained, <hi>exemption from taxes;</hi> but becauſe all the Academiciens were already exempted from them, either by their Nobility, or otherwiſe; not any one of them thought fit to deſire it, leſt he ſhould be thought to ſtand in need of it himſelf: &amp; thus they preferred an imaginary honour, before the ſolid and real intereſt of their ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>It was no difficult matter to get theſe Letters ſealed.

Nay a little while after he ſent to tell the Company by Monſieur <hi>de Ceriſy,</hi> that he deſired to be comprized in the Catalogue of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiciens, which was ſoon after done. You ſhall ſee anone, how this Propoſition was received; at preſent it ſhall ſuffice to tell you that he ſealed the Letters with all Speed,<note place="margin">Reg.

               <p>There wanted but two things for the entire eſtabliſhment of this Body: the one, to get their Statutes Authorized by the Cardinall, according to the power giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115385:26"/>
him thereto by the Kings Letters. The other to get thoſe Letters ratified in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt was very eaſie, the ſecond on the contrary accompanyed with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and delayes. To get the ſtatutes Authorized by the Cardinal,<note place="margin">Reg. Feb. 5. 1635.</note> who was then at <hi>Ruel,</hi> they ſent to him the 3. officers, with Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert.</hi> I have heard Monſieur <hi>Conrart</hi> ſay, who was of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation as an officer, and whom I think you will acknowledge for a juſt judge in ſuch matters, that he never heard a man ſpeak better then the Cardinal did in this meeting, that he anſwered to the ſpeech of Monſieur <hi>de Serizay,</hi> the director, as if he had ſeen it a long time before hand, and had leiſure enough to prepare himſelf upon the the head of it, and even upon every word that was in it; that he ſpake firſt for the Academie, in generall; then he addreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the 4. Deputies, and at laſt to each of them apart, but ſo appoſite, with ſo much grace, civility, majeſtie and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he raviſht all that heard him,<note place="margin">Reg. February 22. 1635.</note> with admiration. He cauſed them at laſt to leave the Statutes behind, that he might view them, and ſent them back ſome time after ſigned with his own hand, and counterſigned by <hi>Charpentier</hi> his Secretary and ſealed with his armes <hi>En placard.</hi> But I muſt not forget to tell you that this was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had cauſed one thing onely in it to be changed, which would have ſeemed to be too much to his advantage, and to tax
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:115385:27"/>
him of a little vanity. The fifth Article of the Statutes was in ſubſtance, <hi>That every Academicien ſhould promiſe to reverence the vertue &amp; memory of my Lord their Protectour.</hi> He deſired that this article ſhould be taken away, and the Company ordered it ſhould be ſo, in obedience to his Eminence; but that there ſhould be mention of it made in the Regiſters.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now queſtionles be very tedious, if I ſhould go about to relate to you exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how much time &amp; paines was requiſite on the other ſide, to get theſe Letters Patens ratifyed in Parliament.<note place="margin">Reg. January 19. and Febuary 5. 1635.</note> After that they were ſigned according to order, by Monſieur <hi>Delomenie</hi> Secretary of ſtate, who was then called Monſieur <hi>de Villeauclair,</hi> and is at preſent Monſieur <hi>the Count of Brienne;</hi> with whom they found no difficulty; they were delivered into the hand of Monſieur <hi>Hennequin</hi> of <hi>Bernay</hi> Counſellor, in <hi>the great Chamber</hi> to make a report of them.

                  <note place="margin">Reg. March 12. March 19. April 16. 1635.</note> but all were to no purpoſe. And although to give the more force to their Sollicitations, after the two firſt, they reſolved to make no more in the name of the Company; but of the Cardinall, who liked well it ſhould be ſo; and though in his name Meſſieurs <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mareſts,</hi>

the which there being only perſons of great worth and learning, it cannot be but very advantageous to the publike, and to the reputation of France.

               <p>Moreover the Cardinal ſignified to the Atturney General who came to viſit him at <hi>Conflans,</hi> that he abſolutely deſired this ratification, and that having ſet his ſeale to the Statutes of the Academie, he judged them worthy the priviledges that were granted to them. He alſo let the cheife Preſident know, that for feare there ſhould yet be delayes and obſtacles in this affaire, he ſhould cauſe the Letters to be preſented and ratified in the grand Councell. They continued the ſollicitings in his name, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115385:29"/>
thoſe which did it, ſaid from him, that h had forbidden the Academie to trouble it ſelfe any more about it, being reſolved, it ſhould receive this favour only from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. At length the Atturney Generall gave his favourable determination, and Monſieur <hi>Savarre,</hi> Counſellor in <hi>the great Chamber,</hi> in whoſe hands the Letters were, profeſſed alſo his great willingneſſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall, <hi>That he did not believe, ſince he was of the Parliament, he had received a greater honour then the contributing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the eſtabliſhment of the Academie.</hi> Nevertheleſſe he had not this ſatisfaction, for he fell ſick ſome few daies after: and whether 'twere that there were yet ſome other obſtacles, or that his ſickneſſe which was long, and of which he died at laſt, was the cauſe of it, ſo if was, that the Letters returned into the hands of Monſieur <hi>de Bernay,</hi> &amp; were not ratified, till a year after or more, the 10th. of July 1637. with this clauſe, <hi>Provided that thoſe of the Aſſembly &amp; Academie, take no cognizance but only of the ornament embelliſhment &amp; augmentation of the French Tongue; and of the books that ſhall be made by themſelves, and by others that ſhall deſire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Academie being aſſembled three daies after, wou'd have deputed ſome to go thank the Cardinal; but he ſent them word by Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert,</hi> that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it not, and that they ſhould go only to thanke Monſieur <hi>de Bernay</hi> the reporter, Monſieur the Atturney Generall, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115385:29"/>
Monſieur the chief Pereſident, which was done by the three Officers. At laſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Tillet,</hi> Clark of the Parliament, ſent the Atteſt of the Ratification to the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie then aſſembled the laſt of July in the ſame yeare. His Secretary that had the charge of it, was brought into the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and thanked in the name of the whole Body, by the director.</p>
               <p>Thus the FRENCH ACADEMIE, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they aſſembled all this while, and had the ſame meetings which they have at this day, was nevertheleſſe not abſolutely eſtabliſhed, till three yeares and ſome moneths after that they began to labour in it. For they ſpent from the moneth of February of the yeare, 1634. to that of the yeare following, 1635, to give it the forme it was to have, to make ready its ſtatutes, and to get the order of its Erection ſealed, and from February 1635. till July 1637. to get this order confirm'd in Parliament.</p>
               <p>WHEN YOU reade this, I make no queſtion but you will enquire with ſome aſtoniſhment, for what reaſon and out of what <hi>Caprichio,</hi> ſo judicious a Body as the Parliament of Paris, gave their conſent with ſo much difficulty to a deſign, I will not ſay ſo innocent, but ſo laudable. But that you may the better underſtand what was the humour of the Parliament, tis requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite I let you know, how all France at that time ſtood affected, where the Cardinal de Richelieu having advanced the Regal
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115385:30"/>
authority much higher then ever any man had done before, was loved and adored of ſome, envied of others, hated and deteſted of many; feared, and redoubted of almoſt all. Beſides then, that the Academie was a new inſtitution, which of it ſelfe would have divided mens opinions, and at the ſame time have had enemies and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, they looked upon it as a work of the Cardinals, and judged either well or ill of it, acording to the paſſion wherewith they were prepoſſeſſed of him. Thoſe which were his freinds, ſpake of it with exceſſive praiſes: Never had ages paſt, ſay they, ſo much eloquence, as ours ſhall have, we ſhall ſurpaſſe all that have gone before us, and all that ſhall come after us, and the greateſt ſhare of this glory will be due to the Academie and to the Cardinal. On the other ſide his Enemies, and thoſe which envyed him entertained this deſigne with ſcoffs and jeeres. They accuſed the Academie of coining new words, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to impoſe laws upon things that were not capable to receive them, and they ceaſed not to decry it by railleries and ſatyrs. The people too, and thoſe that were either leſſe quick-ſighted, or more jealous, who ſuſpect every thing that comes from the Cardinal, were affraid leſt that under theſe flowers there lay hid a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and apprehended at the leaſt that this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115385:30"/>
eſtabliſhment would be a new ſupport to his domination, that they muſt be his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, taking pay to doe whatever he pleaſe, and to obſerve the actions and thoughts of others. Nay they ſay he cut off fourſcore thouſand livres of the money leavied for the cleanſing of the ſtreets of <hi>Paris,</hi> to give to them 2000 livres penſion a peice; and a hundred reports of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe, if you will give me leave to mingle a little mirth with ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to forget a while the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris to which I will not faile to returne: I could tell you a couple of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which will ſerve not only for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but alſo for a confirmation of what I told you even now concerning the opinion which the vulgar had of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie. The firſt is of a certain tradeſman of Paris, who had, they ſay, lately hired a houſe very commodious for him in <hi>Cinq-Diamans ſtreet,</hi> where Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> dwelt, at whoſe houſe the Academie then met. He obſerved that at certaine daies there came a great number of Coaches thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he enquired the reaſon of it, and learning it, preſently hebrok off his bargain without giving any other reaſon, but that he would not dwell in a ſtreet, wherein there was every week a Cademy of Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polizers.</p>
               <p>The other ſtory is perhaps no leſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant then the former. When my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115385:31"/>
and I <hi>went to ſchole,</hi> we had leave to go ſpend the time of the vacation in the Country, at ſome of our friends houſes, ſomtimes at <hi>Ondes</hi> that ſweet dwelling, whoſe name and delights I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; and ſomtimes in <hi>Gaſcogne</hi> at Monſieur <hi>Dubourg s</hi> in his faire houſe of <hi>Chermont.</hi> This Gentleman, as you doubtleſſe knew, together with a great knowledge in good learning, and much wit, was maſter of ſo gay and pleaſant a humour, that he could almoſt in every thing find matter of mirth, but ſo noble and gallant, as 'twas decent and becoming a perſon of quality, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was, having the honour to reckon amongſt his anceſtors the famous <hi>Anne Duboury</hi> Counſellor in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Antonie Duboury</hi> Chancellor of France, in the Reigne of Francis the firſt. We were then at his houſe, and Monſieur <hi>de Fontrailles,</hi> his next neighbour, whom you know very well, and who ſince hath borne ſo great a part in one of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affaires of our times, was there alſo. There came thither a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman newly arrived from Court; they asked him (as the faſhion is) what newes there. He anſwered that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more remarkable there, then an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie eſtabliſhed within theſe few yeares by my Lord the Cardinal de Richelieu for the reformation of ſtyle. You ſhall ſee, ſaies Monſieur <hi>Duboury,</hi> who intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be merry, that this man will have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115385:31"/>
ſome new deſign againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and other Lawyers to force them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reforme their ſtyle, or elſe fine. The young Gentleman, who perhaps had heard of the falſe reports that had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out in Paris of the Academie, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in good earneſt that his Landlord might be in the like error, and to diſabuſe him, labour'd all he could to demonſtrate to him by very good reaſons that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſtyle reſpected only Poets and Orators. Monſieur <hi>Duboury,</hi> ſeeing the pleaſant humour he was in, continued his diſcourſe and anſwer'd that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall was more crafty then 'twas believed, that within theſe ten yeares all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, which we have ſeene, have had as faire beginnings, and as honeſt pretences but that they would infallibly come from Orators to Lawyers, and lay a fine upon them for every fault they commit, and to get themſelves off, force them to pay vaſt ſummes of mony; that one by name * * * who was his Lawyer in the Parliament of Tholoſe, was ruin'd. For, added he, tis impoſſible he ſhould reforme himſelf; he has belonged to the law ſome thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, when ever he thinks to make a Complement, ſtill there eſcapes him ſome wrangling Law Term or other. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, he appealed to Monſieur <hi>de Fontrailles</hi> as judge, who approved and conſented to all he had ſaid, nor was the young Gentleman ere the leſſe obſtinat on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115385:32"/>
the other ſide, as he continued that whole after-ſupper time, and with ſo much zeale in defence of the truth, and relation to ſee ſuch honeſt men in ſo ſtrange an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this ſtory, which perhaps to you that read it, will ſeem frigid, never comes into my mind even to this day, but it makes me ready o laugh.</p>
               <p>But to return now to the Parliament of Paris, and the difficulty it made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Edict of the Academie: You will not believe, and doubtleſſe a man would hardly imagine it, that they ſhould appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it for the ſtile of the Lawyers. For my part, I'le tell you my opinion of it. This great body wherein there are alwaies ſome Extraordinary perſons, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others that are not ſo, was divided, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſſe of the Academie, and of the Cardinall de Richelieu, with the very ſame paſſions and opinions that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all the reſt of France, ſaving perhaps in this Company, there was leſſe affection for him then in others, and that for the moſt part they lookt upon him as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their liberty, and the infringer of of their privileges. I ſuppoſe then that there might be three parties in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above their buſineſſe. The firſt and leaſt, of thoſe who judging of things ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, ſaw not any thing in this deſigne worthy to be blamed or deſpiſed. The 2d. of thoſe, who bring animated againſt the Cardinall, or elſe too much addicted to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115385:32"/>
the ſole ſtudy of the law, and civill affairs, laughted at his Inſtitution as a Childiſh thing; and of this number there was one amongſt them, (as I have heard,) who giving his voyce concerning the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Letters, ſaid, <hi>That this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe brought into his mind, what one of the Emperours ſomtimes did, who after he had taken away from the Senate the cogniſance of publick affaires, deſired to know their opinions, what ſawce he ſhould make for a great Turbot that was brought him from France.</hi> Finally, I believe there was a third &amp; laſt party, which it may be, was not the leaſt powerfull, of thoſe that ſupected every thing, and apprehended as well as the Vulgar, ſome dangerous Conſequence of this Inſtitution. Of this I have two proofs in a manner convincing; Friſt the Cardinals Letter, wherein you ſee he aſſures the Chief Preſident. <hi>That the Academiciens had a Deſign wholly different from what he was made to believe.</hi> Secondly, That Clauſe in the Order for the Confirmation, <hi>That the Academie ſhould take cogniſance onely of the French Tongue, and the Books which they themſelves made, or which were offered to their judgment:</hi> As if there had been ſome danger, that it would have taken to it ſelf other functions, and have undertaken ſome greater matters. And this, as I think, is the cauſe of thoſe hinderances which for two years retarded the confirmation of theſe Lettrrs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:115385:33"/>I SHOULD HERE put an end to the firſt part of my work, touching the birth and foundation of the Academie, but that I remember I ſpake, by the way, of ſome Satyres which at the firſt were made againſt it; and that, to omit nothing, 'tis fit, I ſhould now ſay ſomething to you of them, as of ſome other Circumſtances of its Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>The firſt that wrote againſt the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie was the <hi>Abbot of</hi> St. <hi>Germain,</hi> who was then at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> accompanying the Queen Mother <hi>Mary de Medici</hi> in her baniſhment. As he continually bayted by his writings, and that with a ſharp kind of animoſity, all the actions of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> ſo he omitted not to ſpeak very injuriouſly of the FRENCH ACA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEMIE, which he Confounded with that other Academie, which the Gazelier <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uandot</hi> had eſtabliſhed at the <hi>Bereau d'Adreſs;</hi> whether 'twere that he did purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtake ſo or that indeed he had but ill intelligence how things went at <hi>Paris.</hi> The Academie would not anſwer to it in a work on purpoſe; but Monſieur <hi>de Chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> who was of it, and did then in behalf of the Cardinall anſwer moſt of thoſe <hi>Bruſſel</hi>-pamphlets, was deſired, after that he himſelf had propounded it in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to add a few lines about this buſineſſe, which were afterwards read and approved by the Company. The Abbot <hi>of</hi> St. <hi>Germain,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:115385:33"/>
his peices againſt the Cardinall de <hi>Richelieu</hi> have been ſince printed at Paris in two Volumes, after the death of the late King Lewis the 13th. The anſwers of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>du Chaſtelet,</hi> were in a peice which he finiſhed not, being prevented by death, and which was never printed.</p>
               <p>Of all the other things that have been made againſt this Company, I have not above three of them which deſerve to be mention'd. The firſt is that <hi>Comedie of the Academie,</hi> which after it had paſt a long time in manuſcript, was at length printed in the year 1650. but with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of faults, and without either Author or Printers name. Some are pleaſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it to one of the Academiciens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe it does not ill reſemble his Style, witt, and humors, and becauſe he is there ſpoken of as a man that makes no great reckoning of theſe conferences. But ſome others have aſſured me, that it was a Gentleman's of <hi>Normandy,</hi> by name Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Evermond.</hi> And truly if the Author of it was of the Academie, I'de ſay he put many things into it, on purpoſe to make it be believed that he was not of it: as when he makes Monſieur <hi>Triſtan</hi> an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicien, who was not ſo yet, untill 10: yeares after; alſo when he brings in the Marquis of <hi>Brevale,</hi> deliberating whether he ſhould go to the war, or ſtay in the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie: The Marquis of <hi>Brevale,</hi> I ſay, who was never of it, and of whom I do not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115385:34"/>
find any mention great or ſmall in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters; nor in the notes which have been communicated to me: This piece though artleſſe and irregular, and rather deſerving the name of a <hi>Jig,</hi> then that of a <hi>Comedie,</hi> is not without witt, and has ſome very pleaſant paſſages.</p>
               <p>The ſecond which I am to tell you of, and which has been leſſe ſeen then the reſt, is intituled, <hi>A Role of preſentations made on the great daies of the French Eloquence.</hi> 'Tis as 'twere a regiſter of ſome ridiculous requeſts for the conſervation, or ſuppreſſion of certaine words, together with as many imaginary anſwers of the Academy. As for example, <hi>The Secretaries of</hi> St. <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent preſented themſelves, deſiring, it might be declared that the word Secretary might not ſignifie in good French, the Clark of a Counſellor.</hi> Anſwer, <hi>Remonſtrances ſhall be made concerning it to the Roy de la Bazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. H.</hi> Fierbras <hi>a cadet of Gaſcon preſented himſelf, in behalfe of all thoſe of his Country, requiring that none might take away the point from their honour, nor the glittering from their ſword.</hi> Anſwers, <hi>For what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Point, it ſhould be communicated to the Mathematique profeſſors; and for the Glittering, the Fourbiſhers ſhould be ſent to.</hi> I have been told by ſome that this <hi>Role of preſentations</hi> was made by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Francion,</hi> and of <hi>The Extravagant ſheapheard;</hi> it was preſently printed, and it has been reprinted ſince in the ſame Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115385:34"/>
me with the Comedie; but very much mutilated, and alter'd ſeverall wayes.</p>
               <p>The laſt of theſe three pieces is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious <hi>Request of the Dictionaries,</hi> which too was printed not long ſince in a little Volume with abundance of faults, and was afterwards printed far more correct in <hi>quarto.</hi> Every body knowes that this was made by Monſieur <hi>Menage,</hi> not onely a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned and polite man, but alſo a man of honour and of a ſolid vertue. He himſelf had alwayes a very high eſteem of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and has ſpoken honourably of it in divers of his works. He was a particular and intimate friend, as he is ſtill, of many of the Academiciens, whom he mentions in that <hi>Requeſt,</hi> and he did not do it, as he proteſts himſelf, out of any motion of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or envy, but onely for a diverſion to himſelf, and that he might not loſe ſome <hi>bons mots,</hi> that came into his mind upon that ſubject. Beſides he ſuppreſt it after he had made it, and it lay above ten years hid among his Papers, untill a certain perſon that had then all in cuſtody, ſuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be rob'd of that, by one that you and I know, who preſently after gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Copies of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe three pieces and all the reſt that have been made againſt the Academie, go upon a falſe ground; and deſcribe the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiciens, as men that labour night &amp; day in nothing, but fantaſtically, forging new words, or elſe ſuppreſſing others, more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115385:35"/>
out of humour then reaſon; whereas they thought of nothing leſſe, and when any queſtion was offer'd concerning language, they onely enquired after the uſe of the word, which is the cheif maſter in ſuch matters, and reſolved in favour of it. As for me, who have exactly veiw'd all their Regiſters, I can give them this Teſtimony, that I have there met with many handſome and rationall deciſions, whence M. <hi>Vaugelas</hi> has taken part of his <hi>Remarques;</hi> but that I never found there, any footſteps of ſo much as one of thoſe ſilly Orders, which are attributed to them in theſe <hi>Satyrs.</hi> They made the World then believe all thoſe things; and, as you know, every man hath many times an averſneſſe, of which he cannot give any reaſon, from ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain word and phraſes, which he does not love to uſe. If any one of this Body did expreſſe ſuch a kind of averſneſſe in jeſt or otherwiſe, preſently envy and detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made this paſſe for a deciſion of the Academie's. 'Tis known, for inſtance, that Monſieur <hi>de Gombervile</hi> did not love to uſe the word<note n="*" place="margin">for.</note> 
                  <hi>Car,</hi> which indeed is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive if it be often repeated, and is fitter for a <hi>diſputation,</hi> then a <hi>Romance</hi> or a <hi>Poem.</hi> He brag'd one day that he had rot at all made uſe of this word in the 5. Volumes of <hi>Polexander</hi> (where yet I am told it is thrice); they conclude preſently from this diſcourſe, that the Academie would baniſh the word <hi>Car,</hi> and although
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115385:35"/>
it never had the leaſt thought of it, they made a thouſand jeſts upon it, and this was the Subject of that handſome Letter of <hi>Vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ture's,</hi> which begins <hi>Mademoiſelle Car es tant d'une ſi grand conſideration en noſtre langue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Academie ſhewed its judgment, in that placing its ſelf above calumny it did not vouchſafe to be moved at all the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which were made againſt it: at the very beginning and before it ſaw any of them, it had as twere reſolved, not to make any anſwer to whatſoever ſhould be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. And leſt that any particular perſon ſhould undertake it of his own head, there was an expreſſe article put into the <hi>Statutes,</hi> which forbids all of the Body to meddle in it, without leave and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a publique conſultation about it.</p>
               <p>The Academies of <hi>Italy</hi> ſeem to have gone much farther, and to have reſolved not onely to contemne, but even to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall and (as I may ſo ſay,) outbrave Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, having given themſelves moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious names. Thus the Academie <hi>de gli Intronati,</hi> if you ſearch the originall of the word, ſignifies the Academie of <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards</hi> or <hi>Blockheads,</hi> for <hi>intronato</hi> does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie a man whom the noiſe of thunder hath ſtunned and deprived of his witts: and many others of thoſe Academies that aroſe afterwards, in imitation of that, took not to themſelves more honourable names.</p>

               <p>The Office of the Secretary is to write the reſolutions and to regiſter them, to ſigne all the Acts, to keep all the evidences and all the papers of the Academie, and to make Certificats for thoſe of the Body, that have need of a Teſtimony that they are of it.

               <p>The <hi>Stationer</hi> of the Academie is alſo perpetuall, though he be received upon this condition <hi>ſo long as the Company ſhall thinke fit,</hi> which ſignifies onely that it ſhall be free to take another if it pleaſe. His charge is to be at the Aſſemblies of the Academie as often as he can, to receive its Orders, and to print its works, and thoſe of particular Academiciens; which ſhall be examined by it, and to whom it ſhall give a Certificat of it approbation. The Statute, (with nevertheleſſe they begin to diſpenſe with, of late,) ſaies, that tis to thoſe works only to which 'tis permitted to Subſcribe, <hi>By ſuch a one of the French Academie.</hi> And that they may not be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any other Stationer but he; who is bound to change nothing in it after the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Academie, to which for this end he takes an oath at his firſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his charge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Director</hi> and the <hi>Chancellor</hi> are to be choſen by lot after this manner. They take

                  </gap>ers, and it is not Incompatible with his own. It is obſerved as a <hi>Caprichio</hi> of fortune, that from the very beginning of the Academie to this preſent, Monſieur <hi>Chapelain,</hi> who is without queſtion one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable perſons of the Company, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet <hi>Director</hi> nor <hi>Chancellor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Office of <hi>Secretary;</hi> No man can have it but by the ſuffrages of the Academiciens, Aſſembled to the number of twenty at the leaſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame number of twenty is requiſite for the Election or for the Ejection of an Academicien. Theſe Elections and Ejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are done by white and Black balls: For an Election, the Number of the white muſt be four more then the black: For an Ejection there muſt be 4. black ones more then the white. There is an Article, by which no man can be choſen that is not approved by the Protector. Wherefore
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115385:38"/>
when there is a place voyd in the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, they proceed in this manner. The <hi>Director</hi> moſt commonly or ſome other of the Academiciens propounds him that is preſented to fill it; or if there be more of them, they are all propounded together. Then they appoint ſome one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to know whether the <hi>Protector</hi> be pleaſed, that they conſult about the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him or them, and after that he has given his conſent, to proceed to Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Balls, the next meeting. I find in the Regiſter that the Academiciens which are at <hi>Paris</hi> and are ſick,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg. May</hi> 10. 1652.</note> may ſend their Suffrages in writing, to the Company.</p>
               <p>When an Academicien is admitted, the Statutes muſt be read to him, which he is exhorted to keep; and the act of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion muſt be Regiſtred.</p>
               <p>In all other things but theſe Elections, they muſt give their votes <hi>clarâ voce</hi> aloud; and this muſt be done without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or jealouſy, without reproving in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or contempt the opinion of any one, without ſaying any thing more then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and without repeating what hath been ſaid. The determinations are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to other ſucceeding meetings: I find in the Regiſters that ſometimes the deciſion has been referred to the <hi>Protector;</hi> as for example, being troubled to know whether they ſhould make a Funerall Oration for the Cardinall <hi>de Richelieu</hi> in publick or in private, and the Company being not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115385:39"/>
able to agree about it, they referred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concerning it to the Lord <hi>Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Statutes conteine many things touching the employment of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak elſewhere: onely I obſerve there, that matters of Religion are forbid, and that if they examine any Theologicall writings, it muſt be onely for the termes and form of them. That for Politicall and morall matters, tis ſayd that they ſhall not there be handled, but with conformity to the Authority of the Prince, and to the State of Goverment, and to the Lawes of the Realm. Thoſe which are not of the Academie, may not be admitted into Aſſemblyes Ordinary or Extraordinary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any pretence whatſoever; and when any one deſires to preſent a book to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or give it any other Complement, all the advantage he hath, is, to be brought into the place of the Aſſembly to be heard, and to receive the thanks which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn him, without being preſent afterwards at that dayes Conference. The Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens, which cannot be preſent at the Aſſemblyes, are bound to ſend their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and this was exactly obſerved a while. Now if any one does abſolutely neglect to be preſent there, it is the cuſtome, that if in caſe, he want a Certificate that he is of the Academie, or any other the like act, it may be denyed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:115385:39"/>If any Academicien commit any fault unworthy a man of honour, he may be either expelled, as I ſaid before, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for ſome time, according to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of his fault.</p>
               <p>This law will ſeeme to you at firſt ſight to preſage ill, and you will ſay perhaps, there was no need of one to this purpoſe in the Academie, no more then in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of <hi>Athens,</hi> againſt parricides; but that which hapen'd ſince, which I will tell you elſewhere, will ſhew you that this providence was not altogether unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>To debate upon the publiſhing of any work of the Academiciens, there muſt be twenty at the leaſt, which number the Statutes require, in all affaires of any great conſequence. But to give approbation of any particular mans worke 'tis ſufficient if there be twelve, under which number there can be nothing reſolved either in this, or any thing elſe. This approbation of the Academie muſt be engroſſed in parchment, ſigned by the Secretary, and ſealed with the Academies Seale; it muſt be plaine and without commendation, according to a conſtant form. It is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be printed before the book; but they may put this into the Title, as I told you before; <hi>By ſuch an one of the French Academie.</hi> There are many good rules to this purpoſe, but the difficulties
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115385:40"/>
and delayes, which are mett with in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this kind of approbation, are the cauſe that the Academiciens never look after them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I will add only two Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Statutes. The firſt, by which the Academie impoſes this law upon it ſelf, to judge onely of the works of thoſe of its Body; With this clauſe, That if, for any Important reaſon it find ſelf oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to examine any other, it ſhall plainly declare its opinion, without either cenſure or approbation.</p>
               <p>The other Article, is, that which I ſpake to you of before, and which ſeems to me ſo judicious: by which 'tis forbidden any private member to write any thing of his own head in defence of the Academie, without having thereto obtained leave of the Company aſſembled to the number of twenty at leaſt.</p>
               <p>SUCH ARE the Statutes of the FRENCH ACADEMIE: add we now one word of the daies, places, and forme of their Aſſemblyes.</p>
               <p>The dayes of theſe Aſſemblyes have changed very often, they were at firſt every <hi>Monday</hi> after dinner, as it appeares by one of the articles of the Statutes.<note place="margin">Article 17. <hi>Reg. December</hi> 21. 1637. <hi>Reg. March</hi> 20. 1638.</note> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I know not for what reaſon, they choſe <hi>Tueſday</hi> inſteed of <hi>Monday,</hi> to which nevertheleſſe a while after they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. And yet afterwards when the Lord Chancellor was made Protector of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115385:40"/>
the Academie upon a deſire of it in his name, and to the end that he might be the more often preſent at the Aſſemblyes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg. December</hi> 14. 1643. <hi>Reg. December</hi> 27. 1643.</note> they changed it to <hi>Saturday,</hi> and preſently after to <hi>Tueſday.</hi> There have been divers other Changes of the day which 'tis of no Importance to obſerve, 'tis ſufficient that you know that the Academie muſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble regularly one afternoon every week; and if the Ordinary-Day chance to be a Holy-Day they take another, and moſt commonly that which goes before or that which follows. But if there be any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in hand, they meet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, as when 'twas debated about making the <hi>Platforme,</hi> or the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> of the Academie, and the <hi>ſentiments on the Cid.</hi> And when they deſired to haſten the buſineſſe of the <hi>Dictionary,</hi> they meet ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes and at ſeverall places, as you ſhall ſee anon. Even now, when I write this, they aſſemble twice a week, <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> on purpoſe to forward this work, and to repaire the time that's loſt. The Academie hath commonly its Vacations about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>

               <p>THE PLACE of the Aſſemblyes hath changed oftener then the Day.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. 1643.</note> 16. after the death of Cardinall <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> The Lord Chancellor ſent word to the Company, that he deſired they would for the time to come meet at his houſe: as they have done ever ſince. And truely when I conſider the various retreats, which this Company had for almoſt ten yeares, ſometimes at one end of the Citty, ſometimes at another, till the time of this new Protector: me thinks I ſee the Poets Iſland, <hi>Delos,</hi> Errant and floting untill the birth of its <hi>Apollo.</hi> In earneſt, it would make a man wonder that the Cardinall <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> who founded it did not take a little more care to furniſh it with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant place of meeting. If that be true which the Lawyers ſay, that Temples, Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Theaters, and in a word, all publick
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115385:41"/>
places are as 'twere ſo many ſtrong bonds of civill ſociety, which tye and unite us ſtreightly to one another; he could not doubt but that a certain place aſſigned to the Academie, and common to all that were of it, would in ſome ſort ſtrengthen this ſweet ſociety, and contribute much to its duration. And if otherwiſe he ſought in all things the greatneſſe and immortality of his name, the very terme <hi>Academie</hi> might ſeeme to hint to him, that the ſmall expence in a buſineſſe of this nature, would make him more talked of hereafter, then a thouſand other ſtately Edifices. For, pardon me that I make this digreſſion, how many Kings and great men have there been, of whom we are Ignorant whether they ever had a being, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe have founded Temples &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifique places? <hi>Academus</hi> on the other ſide was onely a petty burgeſs of <hi>Athens,</hi> yet was pleaſed to beſtow upon the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers of his time, a garden of ſome Acres of ground, in the ſuburbs of that famous Citty; This place was called the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> from whence comes that word ſo well known at this day over the whole world, which will make the name and memory of this <hi>Hero</hi> live for ever; So the Greek Hiſtory poſitively calls him, though we do not find that he ever did any thing elſe that was remarkable.</p>
               <p>All theſe things, which the Cardinall was not Ignorant of, would make one
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:115385:42"/>
believe what divers have ſayd, that having long intended to build in the Horſe-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, neer the gate of Saint <hi>Honorè,</hi> a great <hi>Piazzo,</hi> which he would have called <hi>Ducale</hi> or the Dukes place, in imitation of the <hi>Royall,</hi> which is at the other end of the City, he would there have ſet apart ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lodgings for the Academy, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that he would have endowed it with ſome reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; but that this deſign and many others which he reſerved for more calm and quiet times, was interrupted by his death.</p>
               <p>AS for the <hi>form</hi> of the Academies meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tis thus. In winter they are in an upper, in ſummer in a lower roome of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guier Hoſtel:</hi> and without much ceremony, they ſit round a table; the <hi>Director</hi> on that ſide next the Chimny: the <hi>Chancellor</hi> and <hi>Secretary</hi> at each hand of him, and all the reſt as fortune, or Common civility rankes them. The <hi>Director</hi> preſides. The <hi>Secretary</hi> keeps the Regiſter. This <hi>Regiſter</hi> is at other times kept very exactly from day to day; but at preſent, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Dictionary</hi> being the ſole im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Academie, tis kept on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thoſe meetings, where there happens any thing extraordinary and important. When the <hi>Protector</hi> is preſent, he ſits in the place of the <hi>Director,</hi> who, with the other two officers, ſit at his left hand. He gathers the votes and pronounces the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, as the <hi>Director</hi> uſes to do. The

                  <hi>Cardinall</hi> was never there; but the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> is often preſent, and does all what I told you but now. That which is moſt remarkable is, that he honoured this Company with his preſence, not onely at his leiſure and when free from buſineſſe; as many others that never ſtudy but when they have nothing elſe to do: but even when he was moſt in favour, and had the greateſt Imployments. I find particularly in the Regiſters that he was preſent there the 19th. of <hi>December</hi> 1643.<note place="margin">

They give Him alſo this Teſtimony, that at theſe meetings tis not poſſible to uſe one with more civility then he does all the Academiciens; and that he preſides with the ſame familiarity, that any one amongſt them could do, even to the taking pleaſure in being ſtopt, and interrupted, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding even thoſe very Gentlemen that are his Domeſtiques, to call him <hi>My Lord.</hi>

Menage</hi> obſerves very well in his <hi>Origines,</hi> that it was firſt uſed by Monſieur <hi>Sarrazin,</hi> a long while after. Then we may ſay that it not onely paſſed in <hi>France,</hi> but that it has overrun it, and made ſtrange havock there. Is it not plain that for theſe laſt yeares we have played at this game, where he that wins, loſes? and is it not the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of moſt men, that to write well in this kind, 'tis ſufficient to ſpeake things that have neither ſenſe nor reaſon. Every one thinks himſelf able enough for it, of what ſex ſoever, from the Ladies and Lords at Court to the Chambermaides and Pages. This madneſſe of <hi>Burleſque,</hi> which at laſt we begin to be cured of, went ſo far, that the Stationers would meddle with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that had not his name in the front; that whether out of ignorance, or the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to put off their wares, they fixt it upon things that were the moſt ſerious, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely that they were ſhort verſes: whence it was that in the time of the war at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1639. they printed a piece, bad enough in deed, but yet ſerious, with this title, which ſtrook with horror all thoſe that read no more of it, <hi>The Paſſion of our Lord in Burleſque verſes,</hi> and the learned Monſieur <hi>Maudaeus,</hi> who doubtleſſe was of this number, reckons it amongſt the <hi>Burleſque</hi>-books of our times.</p>
               <p>I beg your pardon for this digreſſion, which a juſt anger againſt this unſufferable
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115385:46"/>
abuſe drew from me. To returne to my ſubject; The Academie ſpent all the time of its Conferences in hearing or examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Diſcourſes. This employment was very well liked by ſome of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miciens, but moſt of themwere not well pleaſ'd with an exerciſe, which when all is done, wa too like the declamations of young boyes: and the Cardinall alſo expreſt that he look'd for ſomething greater and of more ſolidity from ſuch a Society. They began to talk of the <hi>Dictionary</hi> and the <hi>Grammer,</hi> when Fortune threw another work upon the Academie, which they little expected.</p>
               <p>AS many times one man that is of great Eminence, is able to lead the Dance to a whole Kingdom; that great love which the Cardinall bore to Dramatique Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems, had at this time raiſed them amongſt the French, to the higheſt pitch that they ever were at. All, that found they had any Genius that way, failed not to labour for the Stage. 'Twas the onely meanes to get acceſſe to the Grandees, and to be favoured by the prime Miniſter of State, who ſcarce liked any of the divertiſments of the Court, but that. 'Twill not be amiſſe ere I paſſe farther to let you know how much he was addicted to it. He was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent with much delight at all new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, but took pleaſure alſo to conferr with the poets to ſee their <hi>deſign</hi> in its birth and to furniſh them himſelf with plots. And
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115385:47"/>
if he knew any good wit that of himſelf had no great inclination to travaile in this kind, He would inſenſibly engage him in it, with all manner of care and good uſage. Thus ſeeing that Monſieur <hi>Deſmarests</hi> was very averſe from it, he deſired he would at leaſt invent a plot for a Comedie, which he would get ſomebody elſe, he ſaid, to make up. Monſieur <hi>Deſmarests</hi> brought him four, preſently after; That of <hi>Aſpaſiae,</hi> which was one of them, pleaſed him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly, but after he had given him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Commendations, he added, <hi>That he onely that was able to invent it, would be able to handle it worthily.</hi> And obliged Monſieur <hi>Deſmareſts</hi> to make him the like every year. And when he thought to excuſe himſelf with being employ'd about his Heroique Poem of <hi>Clovis,</hi> of which he had already made two books, it ayming at the glory of France, and even of the Cardinall himſelf; the Cardinall anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had rather enjoy the fruits of his Poetry, as much as 'twas poſſible, and that believing he ſhould not live to ſee the end of ſo long a work, he conjur'd him for his ſake to buſy himſelf in making Playes, wherewith he might refreſh himſelf with pleaſure from the wearineſſe of greater affaires. By this meanes he got him to compoſe the inimitable Comedy <hi>Des Viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeires [or the Fanaricks]</hi> the Tragicomedie of <hi>Scipio,</hi> that of <hi>Roxana, Mirame,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropa.</hi> 'Tis true indeed that part of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115385:47"/>
plot and humors of <hi>Mirame</hi> were his own' and hence 'twas, that he expreſt a Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tenderneſſe of this piece, the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation whereof ſtood him in two or three thouſand crowns, and for which he cauſ'd that great Hall of his Palace to be built, which ſtill ſerves for theſe Shews. And no queſtion but he himſelf invented the plots of the three other Comedies namely, <hi>The Tuilleries, The blind man of Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>The Grand Paſtorall.</hi> In this laſt there were at leaſt five hundred verſes of his own making, but it was not printed as the other two were: the reaſon was this. When he had a deſign to publiſh it, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiw it, and make exact obſervations upon it. Theſe obſervations were brought to him by Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert,</hi> and though they were written with very much diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reſpect, ſo vext and nettled him, whether for their number, or for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they gave him of his faults, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had read them through, he tore them in pieces. But the night following as he was in bed, and all the houſe aſleep, having conſidered of the Choler he had betray'd, he did a thing incomparably more to be eſteemed then the beſt Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the world, 'twas that he yeilded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to reaſon, for he commanded the torn peices of this paper to be gather'd up, and layd together again, and after he had read it from one end to the other, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115385:48"/>
made deep reflexion upon it, he ſent to have Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert</hi> waked to tell him, <hi>that he preceived well that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Academie underſtood theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters better then he, and he muſt talk no more of having this printed.</hi> He cauſed to be made the verſes of thoſe pieces (which were then called <hi>The pieces of the five Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>) by five ſeverall perſons, diſtributing to each an Act, and by this meanes finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Comedie in one month. Theſe five perſons were <hi>M. de Boiſrobert, Corneille, Colletet, de l'Estoille, de Rotrou,</hi> on whom, beſides the Ordinary penſion he gave them, he beſtowed conſiderable gratuities, when they writt nobly according to his minde. Thus <hi>M. Colletet</hi> has aſſur'd me, that when he carryed to him, The <hi>Monologue</hi> of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> he ſtopt particularly upon two verſes of the deſcription of the ſquare Fiſh-pond, at this paſſage.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>La cane s'humecter de la bourbe de l'eau.</l>

                  <l>Animer le canard qui languit auprés d'elle.</l>
               </q>
               <p>And that after he had heard all the reſt, he gave him with his own hand fifty piſtoles, with theſe obliging words, <hi>That 'twas onely for theſe two verſes which he found ſo excellent; and that the King himſelf was not rich enough to reward him for all the reſt.</hi> M. <hi>Colletet</hi> told me one thing more which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115385:48"/>
was very pleaſant. In that paſſage which I related to you juſt now, inſteed of <hi>La cane sohumecter de la bourbe de l'eau,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall would perſwade him to put in, <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botter dans la bourbe de l'eau.</hi> He delired, to be excuſed, as conceiving that word too low: and not content with what he then ſaid, when he was returned to his lodging, he wrote a Letter to him about it, perhaps that he might ſpeak of it with the more freedome. The Cardinall had newly read it, when there came in ſome of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who complementing to him about ſome of his Majeſties happy ſucceſſes in the wars, told him, <hi>That nothing was able to withſtand his Eminence: You'r deceived,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers he laughing, <hi>for I find even here in</hi> Paris <hi>thoſe that withſtand me.</hi> And when they asked him, who thoſe were that durſt be ſo audacious, <hi>Colletet,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quarrel'd with me yeſterday about a word, he will not yeild it, but has even now writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me a large Letter here, about it.</hi> He made afterwards thoſe Comedies of the five Authous, be acted before the King and the whole Court, the Stage being very magnificently adorned. Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had a ſeat by themſelves in one of the moſt convenient places, they even named them ſomtimes with praiſe, as at the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>the Tuilleries,</hi> in a Prologue made in proſe, where among other things the invention of the plot was attributed to <hi>M. Chapelain,</hi> who yet did onely mend it in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115385:49"/>
ſome places; but the Cardinall deſired him to ſend him his name in this occaſion; adding, <hi>that in recompence he would lend him his purſe in any other.</hi> It was about this time that <hi>M. Corneille;</hi> who was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon till then, as one of the chiefeſt in that kind of writing, having let his <hi>Cid</hi> be acted, was placed, at leaſt in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, infinitly above all others. 'Tis hardly imaginable with what oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation this piece was received by the Court, and by the publique. They were never weary with ſeeing it, they talked of nothing elſe in Company, every body could ſay ſome part of it by heart, they made their Children learn it, and in many places of <hi>France,</hi> it went for a proverb, to ſay, <hi>Tis as brave as the Cid.</hi> It need not be asked, whether the glory of this Author raiſed jealouſy in his Concurents: many would perſwade us, that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall himſelf was not free from it, and that (though he eſteemed <hi>M. Corneile</hi> very much, and gave him a penſion) he was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſee, that other pieces of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eſpecially thoſe wherein he had any hand, were quite diſcredited by this. For my part, without examining, whether this Soul as great as it was, were capable of this weakneſſe, I ſhall faithfully report what paſſed in this buſineſſe, leaving eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to believe what he pleaſes of it, and to follow his own conjectures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:115385:49"/>Amongſt thoſe that could not endure the approbation that was given to <hi>The Cid</hi> and that believed it did not deſerve it, <hi>Monſieur de Scudery</hi> appeared the firſt, in publiſhing his <hi>obſervations</hi> againſt it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his own ſatisfaction, or as ſome ſay, to pleaſe the Cardinall, or for both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whatſoever the reaſon were, moſt certain it is, that in this difference which divided the whole Court, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ſeemed to incline to M. <hi>de Scudery's</hi> ſide, and was well pleaſed that he dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, as he did, to <hi>the French Academie,</hi> to referr himſelf in it to their judgment. One may well enough perceive the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls deſire, which was that it ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in this buſineſſe. But the moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious of this body expreſt very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to this deſign. They ſaid, <hi>That the Academie, which was but newly born, ought not by any meanes to ronder it ſelf odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by a judgment, which would perhaps diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe both parties, and could not chooſe but diſoblige one of them at the least, that is to ſay, a great part of</hi> France. <hi>That It was hardly borne with, out of a meere imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they had, that it pretended to a kind of Empire in the language; what would it be if it ſhould manifest that it affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and ſhould go about to exerciſe it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a work which has given content to a great number, and gained the approbation of the people; That it would moreover retard its principall deſign, the execution whereof muſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115385:50"/>
needs of it ſelf be but too ſlow. That laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monſieur Corneille, did not deſire this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that by the Statutes of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and by the Patent of its foundation, it could not judge of any work without conſent and approbation of the Author.</hi> But the Cardinall had this deſign in his head, and theſe reaſons ſeemed to him very ſlight, ſaving the laſt, which might be taken away by the conſent of M. <hi>Corneille.</hi> For the effecting thereof, M. <hi>de Boiſrobert,</hi> who was one of the chief friends, writ to him divers Letters, acquainting him with M. <hi>de Scudery's</hi> propoſall to the Academie. He, who ſaw well enough, that after the glory which he had acquired, there was in all probability more to be loſt then gotten by him at this diſpute, kept himſelf upon the complement, and anſwer'd. <hi>That this Imployment was too low for the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. That a Libel, which deſerv'd no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at all, did not deſerve its Judgment. That it would be of dangerous conſequence, becauſe it would authorize and encourage others to importune theſe Gentlemen, and that as ſoon as there ſhould appear any thing hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome upon the Stage, preſently the leſſer Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets would think they had ground to commence a ſuit againſt the Author of it, before their Society. But at laſt, being preſſed by</hi> M. <hi>de Boiſrobert,</hi> who gave him ſufficiently to underſtand the deſire of his maſter, after he had ſaid in a Letter of the 13th. of <hi>June</hi> 1637. the words which I now related, he

I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt it.</hi> There wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, at leaſt in the opinion of the Cardinall, to ground the Academies juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, who yet did ſtill excuſe themſelves from undertaking this buſineſſe: but at laſt he declared himſelf openly, ſaying to one of his domeſtiques, <hi>Let thoſe Gentlemen know that I deſire it, and that I ſhall love them, according as they love me:</hi> Then they perceived there was no way to avoyd it; and the Academie being aſſembled on the 16. of <hi>June</hi> 1637.<note place="margin">

To hear them, he was pleaſed to be alone in his Chamber, except M. <hi>de Bautru</hi> whom he called for, as being of the Academie.

M. <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelain</hi> as he told me himſelf, endeavour'd to excuſe M. <hi>de Ceriſy</hi> the beſt he could, but he ſoon found that this man would not be contradicted. For he ſaw him grow hot and active, in ſo much that coming to him he took him by the bandſtrings and held him ſo, a good while, as a man will do, not thinking of it, when he would ſpeak home to another, whom he would convince of ſomething. The concluſion was, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

he had explained to them in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he thought this work ſhould have been written, he gave it in charge to M. <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who had indeed a very good Style, and that far from all affection: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did M. <hi>Sirmond</hi> ſatifie him at all.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115385:53"/>
ſubmiſſion, both for what they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in his writings, and for what they had taught him in correcting him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in concluſion, that he was entirely ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the juſtice they had done him. The <hi>Secretary</hi> was commanded to write him an anſwer. The ſenſe of it was, that <hi>he</hi> aſſur'd him, <hi>That the Academie had made it their Principal care to hold the ballance right, and not to make a matter of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Civility of a ſerious buſineſſe. But that their greateſt care after this was, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe themſelves with moderation, and to tell their reaſons, without wronging any one. That they were well pleaſed with the juſtice he had done them, in acknowledging them juſt, that they would hereafter requite his equity; and that on all occaſions, where it would be permitted them to be obliging, he ſhould not faile of it.</hi> As for <hi>M. Corneille,</hi> though he would hardly have ſummit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this judgment, yet being reſolved to comply with <hi>the Cardinall</hi> herein, he expreſt at the beginning that he attended the event of it with a great deale of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. To this purpoſe he writ to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert</hi> in a Letter of the 15th. of <hi>November</hi> 1637. <hi>I expect with a great deal of impatience the Sentiments of the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that I may learn from hence forward what I muſt follow; till then, I cannot write but with diſtruſt, nor dare I confidently make uſe of any word.</hi> And in another, of the third of <hi>December; I prepare my ſelf
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115385:53"/>
not to have any thing to anſwer to the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie, but thanks.</hi> But when <hi>the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Cid,</hi> were almoſt quite printed, having underſtood by ſome meanes that this judgment would not be ſo favourable to him, as he hoped; he could not refrain from expreſſing ſome reſentment of it, writing in another Letter of which I have ſeen onely a Copie without date or Subſcription, <hi>I am reſolved, ſince you will have it ſo, to ſuffer my ſelf to be condemned by our Illuſtrious Academie, if it meddles onely with one half of the Cid, the other will remaine unto me whole and entire. But I beſeech you to conſider that it proceeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me with ſo much violence, and that it makes uſe of ſo ſoveregin an Authority, to ſhut my mouth, that thoſe who ſhall know its proceedings, will have reaſon to think that I ſhould never have been found guilty if I might have been permitted to ſhew my Innocence.</hi>

               <p>He adds to this. <hi>After all, behold what is my ſatisfaction! I aſſure my ſelf this famous work, which ſo many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant witts have been theſe ſix months <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the Sentiments or opinion of the French Academie, but perhaps 'twill never be the opinion of the reſt of</hi> Paris; <hi>at leaſt I have my ſentence before them, and I know not whether they can expect theirs. I made the CID to divert my ſelf, and for the divertiſment of honeſt people that delight in Comedies. 'Tis a ſufici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſtimony to me of the Excellency of my piece, that it has been ſo often acted, that there has been ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary concourſe of people to ſee it, and ſuch general acclamations given it. All the favour the Sentiment of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie can hope for, is to go as farr; I do not fear it will out go me, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after, <hi>The Cid will alwayes be handſome, and will keep its reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being the beſt piece, that 'has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd upon the Stage, untill there comes another, which will not tire the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, even at the 30th. time. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At laſt, when he had ſeen the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Academie, I find that he writ a Letter to Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert, Decemb.</hi> 22. 1637. in which after he had thanked him, for the care he had taken to let him taſte the <hi>Cardinals</hi> bounty namely in getting him his penſion paid, &amp; after he had given him ſome orders to have this mony kept for him at <hi>Roan,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I beſeech you to believe that I am not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115385:54"/>
at all angry that you have ſhowen, nay gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, my Letter to the Gentlemen of the Academie. If I had deſired it of you, I could blam onely my ſelf; but if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory faile me not, I think, I onely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you in that Letter, to aſſure them of my moſt humble ſervice, as I deſire you would do ſtill, notwithſtanding their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. All that troubles me, is that the Gentlemen of the Academie, having reſolved to be judges in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, before they knew whether I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it or no, and their ſentiments being already in the preſſe, as you write me word, before you received that Teſtimony of mine, they have endeavoured to build their judgment thereupon, and make it be beleeved, that what they have done therein, was onely to oblige me, and at my entreaty, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after; <hi>I was reſolved to anſwer them, becauſe Ordinarily the ſilence of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor that is written againſt, is taken for a ſign that he ſleights his cenſurers: I have thus uſed it towards Monſieur</hi> de Scudery; <hi>but I did not believe it would become me to do the ſame towards the Gentlemen of the Academie, and I was perſwaded that ſo Illuſtrious a Body did well deſerve, that I ſhould render
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115385:55"/>
them an account of the reaſons upon which I built the conduct &amp; choiſe of my deſign, and therefore I ſhould extreamly force my humor, which is not to write in this kind, and to divulge the ſecrets of my Art. I was confirmed in this reſolution, by the aſſurance which you gave me, that my Lord would be well pleaſed with it, and I reſolved in my ſelf to addreſſe the epiſtle Dediatory to his Eminence, after I had firſt asked his leave. But now that you adviſe me not to anſwer any thing conſidering the perſons that are engaged in it, I want no Interpreter to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, I am ſomewhat more a man of this world then</hi> Heliodore, <hi>who choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to loſe his Biſhoprick then his book, and do more prize the favour of my Maſter, then all the reputation upon earth: I will hold my Peace then, not out of contempt, but reſpect, &amp;c.</hi> This Letter conteined very much more to the ſame purpoſe, and at the bottom he added by way of poſtſcript, <hi>I conjure you, not to ſhew my Letter to my Lord, if you think there hath eſcaped me any word which may be ill taken by his Eminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to that which is imply'd by this Letter, that the Academie had begun to make their Sentiments and even to print
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:115385:55"/>
them, before they had the conſent of Monſieur <hi>Corneille,</hi> as M. <hi>de Boiſrobert</hi> had write him word; I cannot tell what paſt between them, onely this that M. <hi>de Boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robert</hi> might have told him, to oblige him perhaps with the leſſe difficulty to conſent to this judgment, as to a thing already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, and begun, that his reſiſtance could not hinder it. But I know very well by the Regiſters of the Academie, which are very faithfull and very exact at that time, that they began not to ſpeak of <hi>the Cid</hi> till the 16. of <hi>June</hi> 1637. that this was after that they had there read a Letter of Monſieur <hi>Corneille's.</hi> That the firſt which I ſpake of, wherein he ſaid, <hi>The Gentlemen of the Academie may do what they pleaſe, &amp;c.</hi> is dated at <hi>Roan</hi> the 13th. of the ſame month. That thus it might have come to <hi>Paris</hi> and been ſhown to the Academie the 16th, and that laſtly this work was not given to the Printer till about 5.

               <p>Such were the thoughts of the parties moſt intereſſed, touching the work of the French Academie.

Even thoſe that were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, ceaſed not to commend it; and envy it ſelf, that expected all this while when ſomething of this Companies would come forth that it might tear it in pieces, never meddled with this. For my part, I know not whether the famous Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Italie,</hi> ever produced any thing better, or ſo good, upon the like occaſion. I make account in the firſt place, 'tis very
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115385:56"/>
much that without exceeding the bonds of juſtice, theſe Gentlemen could ſatisfie a <hi>prime Favourite,</hi> that had the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>France</hi> at his command, and he too, their <hi>Protector;</hi> who for certain, what ever were the cauſe of it, was incenſed againſt <hi>the Cid.</hi> For I am ſure he would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that they ſhould treat it more hardly, if they had not let him know, in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe, That a <hi>Judge</hi> ought not to ſpeak as a <hi>Party,</hi> and that a man loſes ſo much of his <hi>Authority</hi> as he betrays <hi>Paſſion.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain if you examine this book ſeriouſly you will find in it a very ſolid judgmemt, with which 'tis propable Poſterity will reſt ſatisfied, much learning and much wit without any affectation either of the one or the other; and from the beginning of it to the end, ſo much liberty and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration both together, as can never be ſufficiently commended. Moreover thoſe that fancied to themſelves that the Academie was a Company of ſtrange Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that would do nothing but quarrell about ſyllables, and bring-in ſome new words and baniſh others, and in plain termes, weaken and wound the French Tongue, under pretence of reforming and poliſhing it: Thoſe I ſay, to diſabuſe themſelves, need onely read this piece where they'll find a maſculine &amp; vigorous Style, the Elegance whereof hath nothing forced or ſtrain'd; the terms choiſe, but without ſcruple and ſwelling; the word

                  <hi>Car</hi> and many others which they accuſ'd the Academie of intending to baniſh, very frequently uſed. Nay they'll ſee that it is ſo far from bringing in new words, that it has retain'd ſome which ſeemed to be Antiquated, and which perhaps many men would have ſcrupled to uſe. Thus has it uſed the word <hi>dautant</hi> for <hi>parce que</hi> and <hi>aucunement</hi> inſteed of <hi>en quelque ſort,</hi> which are now a dayes very rarely uſed in that ſence. p. 185. <hi>Dautant que les unes out eſté fait es, devant les regles,</hi> &amp;c. p. 14. ſpeaking of the Academie, <hi>&amp; s'eſt aucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement conſo lee,</hi> &amp;c. p. 89. <hi>nous ſerious aucunement ſatisfaits</hi> p. 113. <hi>Rodrique retourne chez Chimene non plus de nuict, que les tenebres favoriſoient aucunement ſa te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merité,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The ſecond for Conſtruction, which belonged to the Grammer. The third conſiſting in certain Rules which could not properly be referred either to Dictionary or Grammer, becauſe they reſpected neither Barbariſme nor Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme, the matters upon which Grammer and Dictionary imploy the whole extent of their juriſdiction, which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſaid he, were moſt neceſſary for the purity, ornament, grace, elegance, and politeneſſe of Style, and by ſo much the more neceſſary, as there are fewer perſons that know how to write without Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms, and Soleciſms from which a Style may be free, and yet be extreamly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:115385:58"/>As for <hi>Monſieur Chapelain;</hi> at the firſt eſtabliſhment of the Academy, he had made a large project for a Dictionarie, which had been ſeen by the Company. He preſented it to them again, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it deſcends much to particulars &amp; for that 'tis upon this very platform that even to this day they proceed in this work, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will not be beſides the purpoſe, to relate here briefly the contents of it, as I promiſed elſewhere. This Project then ſaid,</p>
               <q>That the deſign of the Academie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render the Language capable of the higheſt Eloquence, it would be needful to make two large Treatiſes, the one of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, the other of Poetry. But that to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the order of nature, there ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede them a Grammar, which ſhould fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out the body of the Language, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are built ornaments of Oratory and the figures of Poetry. That the Grammar ſhould comprehend either the ſimple terms or the received phraſes, or the conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of words one to another. That ſo, in the firſt place, it would be neceſſary to make a Dictionarie, which ſhould be as 'twere the Treaſury, and Magazine of ſimple Terms, and received Phraſes; after which for finiſhing the Grammer, there would remain only an exact Treatiſe to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115385:58"/>
be made of all the Parts of ſpeech, &amp; of all the Conſtructions regular and irregular, with the reſolution of doubts that might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr upon that ſubject. That for the deſign of the Dictionarie, there ſhould be made a ſelection of all deceaſed Authors, that have written the pureſt in our language, and a diſtribution of them to all the Academici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, to the end that each of them read with care, thoſe which ſhall be alotted to him; and that in ſeveral papers, he ſet down in an alphabetical order, the wordes and phraſes which he ſhall beleive to be the beſt French, quoting the paſſage from whence he takes them. That theſe Papers be brought back to the Company, who judging of theſe phraſes and words, may collect in a little time, the whole body of the Language, and inſert in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dictionary the paſſages of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, acknowledging them for Originals in the things that ſhall be cited from them, yet without acknowledging them for ſuch in others, which are tacitly diſapprov'd of, if they be not in the Dictionary. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there may be phraſes and words in uſe, whereof exſamples may not be found in good Authors, that in caſe the Academy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them, they may have a mark ſet upon them, to ſhew that Uſe hath authorized them. That the Dictionary be in one volume, but in two ſeveral parts,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115385:59"/>
Firſt, in an alphabetical order, the ſimple words, whether Nouns or Verbs, or others that deſerve the name of roots, which may have produced compounds, deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, diminutives, and which otherwiſe may have phraſes that are grounded upon them. That in this part, after having put down each ſimple word with ſome mark, to ſignifie what part of ſpeech it is, there follow in order the compounds, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives, diminutives, and the phraſes depending on them, with the authorities, which yet may be omitted for the ſimple words, as being out of doubt, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known to every one. That thereto be added afterwards, the Latin interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for the good of Strangers. That the Maſculine, Feminine, or Common gender of each word, be marked with ſome note. That there may be others to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Poetical terms from thoſe of Proſe: and others to ſignifie thoſe of the lofty, yea mean, and the loweſt kind of ſpeech. That there be obſerved alſo the accents upon long ſyllables. That they mark alſo the differences of <hi>é</hi> when open, and when cloſe for the pronuntiation. That they keep themſelves to the receiv'd orthography, not to moleſt the common reading, nor hinder, but that Books which have been printed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115385:59"/>
formerly, may be read with facility. That they ſhould nevertheleſs endeavour to take away all ſuperfluities that may be cut off without any harm. That in the ſecond part all ſimple words or others, be ſet down without any diſtinction in an alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical Order, with a reference only to the Page of the great Dictionary; where they are explained, and where alſo may be marked alſo all the words and phraſes out of uſe, with their explication, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of old Books, where they are found, with this notice, That theſe words or phraſes belong to the Language, but muſt not be uſed any more. That, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, for the good of Strangers, one may yet, if one will, add a third part, only of ſimple Latine words, with a reference to the pages of the great Dictionary, where they may explain the French words. That they may, leſt the volume be too big, leave out of the Dictionary all proper names of Seas, Rivers, Cities, Mountains, which are alike in all Languages, as alſo privat terms, which enter not into common traffick, and are only invented for the neceſſity of Trades and Profeſſions, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to thoſe that have a mind to it, the liberty to make diſtinct Dictionaries, for the profit of thoſe that addict themſelves
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115385:60"/>
to thoſe particular Knowledges.</q>
               <p>This was the Project of the Dictionary, which Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> made, and was approved of by the Academie. 'Tis true, that ſome time after, Monſieur <hi>Silhon,</hi> who was then <hi>Director,</hi> propounded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not be better, that they might make an end of it quickly, to follow the Common Dictionaries, only adding therto what they ſhould judg meet. But I do not find, that this Propoſition, which was then put off to the next Aſſembly, was either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or ſo much as taken into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again. 'Tis true too, they have not punctually obſerv'd whatever is in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as may be ſeen in that which reſpects the quotations. Yet 'twas reſolv'd at firſt to follow the Project in that, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Catalogue of the beſt reputed Books in our Tongue, to which they at ſeveral times added more according as they thought good. For Proſe, <hi>Amiot, Montagne, du Vair, Deſportes, Charron, Bertaud, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, de la Gueſle, Pibrac, d'Eſpeiſſes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauld le Catholicon, d'Eſpagne, The memoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of Queen Margaret, Coiffeteau, du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron de Sales Biſhop of Geneva, d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rfé, de Molieres, Malherbe, du Pleſſis Mornay,</hi> what ever is extant of <hi>Monſieur Baudin's,</hi> and of <hi>Monſieur du Chaſtelet,</hi> two Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miciens that were lately dead, <hi>Cardinal d'Oſſat de la Nouë, de Dammartin, de Refuge &amp; Audiguier;</hi> to which doubtleſſe they would have added others, as <hi>Bodin</hi> and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115385:60"/>
Paſquier,</hi> which deſerved not to be forgotten. For verſe, they put into the Catalogue <hi>Marot S. Gelais, Ronſard, du Bellay Belleau du Bartas, Deſportes, Bertaud, Cardinal Perron, Garnier, Regnier, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbe, Deſlingendes, Motin, Touvant, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furon, Theophile, Paſſerat, Rapin, Sainte Marthe.</hi> The Book-ſeller to the Academy, was charged to bring to the <hi>Director,</hi> a note of all the principal Authors of the Tongue, and of their ſeveral works. But a while after the Acadamie began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the pains and the length of the citations, and having conſulted many times about it, 'twas reſolved by the advice even of M. <hi>Chapelain,</hi> who was the firſt that put them upon theſe thoughts, not to ſet down the Authorities in the Dictionarie, unleſs in the making of it, they thought good for phraſes that were dubious, to cite ſome approved Author that had uſed them. 'Twas alſo reſolv'd for the furthering of this work, that <hi>the Cardinall</hi> ſhould be given to underſtand, that it would be very fit to chooſe out of the Company, one or two perſons, that ſhould wholly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, and have the principall charge of it; Monſieur <hi>de Boiſrobert</hi> was deſired to mention it, and to propoſe to him M. <hi>de Vaugelas,</hi> and M. <hi>Faret,</hi> as fitteſt for this employment and beſt able to diſcharge it worthily, if they were acquitted from the cares of their fortune, and could beſtow their whole time upon it. <hi>The Cardinall,</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:115385:61"/>
as I find by the anſwer that M. <hi>de Boiſro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> returned to the Academie, gave no anſwer to this propoſ tion, whether 'twere that he did not like it, or that his thoughts were taken up with ſomething elſe. In the mean time, there was not any one in the Academie that offered himſelf voluntarily to take upon him the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this work, every one had his own affaires, and his own private thoughts, from which he was not willing to be taken off. Thus this deſign, for which they even now expreſt ſo much zeal, began to cool; and for eight or ten months, there was no talk of the <hi>Dictionary,</hi> the Academy all this while amuſing it ſelf about other things, which I ſhall tell you o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115385:61"/>
as to this buſineſs, his noble birth &amp; his merit, which has a long time been known to the whole Court. The Cardinal at that time received favourably this overture, and anſwered, That he would, if need were, give the Penſion out of his own purſe. But he deſir'd to ſee, after what manner, M. <hi>de Vaugelas</hi> would proceed in it. They preſented him the two Projects, he liked well the larger, of which I related to you almoſt all.<note place="margin">Reg. June ult. <hi>1639.</hi>
                  </note> The Penſion of 2000 Livres was re-eſtabliſht upon M. <hi>de Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelas;</hi> who went to thank the Cardinal for it, and as he had a very ready wit, and very polite through long practice at Court, and in the choiſeſt company; 'twas then that he made that happy reply which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe you have heard of. For they ſay, that the Cardinal ſeeing him come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his chamber, aroſe with that ſweet and pleaſant Majeſty, which almoſt alwaies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him, and coming towards him, <hi>Well, Monſieur,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you will not forget I hope in your Dictionary the word Penſion.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Monſieur de Vaugelas</hi> making a low reverence to him, anſwered, <hi>No, my Lord, and leſſe that of Gratitude.</hi> From that time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg. Febr.</hi> 7. 1639.</note> began M. <hi>de Vaugelas</hi> to write ſome ſheets of the Dictionary, which he brought afterwards to the Company; and 'twas Order'd,<note place="margin">Reg. Feb. ult <hi>1639.</hi>
                  </note> that at the end of every Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, thoſe words ſhould be read, which were to be examined the next time to the end they might have time to conſider of

them. They propounded once more a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of the beſt Authors to all the Academiciens, to collect out of them the phraſes &amp; the elegancies of the Language, but 'twas never performed. They began to examine the letter A;<note place="margin">

But this care has been almoſt uſeleſſe; For as they travel'd not in theſe four places, neither with the ſame aſſiduity, nor with the like Genius, and force; they were neceſſitated to repaſſe many things, which theſe leſſer boards had decided, in which they were then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed when I wrote this Relation. The
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115385:62"/>
death of two perſons hath happen'd ſince' which has much retarded the deſign of the <hi>Dictionary.</hi> Firſt, that of <hi>Cardinal de Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu,</hi> which, notwithſtanding the care and diligence of the new Protector, hath taken off much of that zeal, with which they went on at firſt. The other is that of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Vaugelas,</hi> who had, as I told you before, the management of this work; not but that they have given the ſame charge to <hi>Monſieur de Mezeray,</hi> who acquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very worthily. But M. <hi>de Vaugelas,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a meaner fortune than he deſerved; after his death, the papers of the Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, with the reſt of his writings were ſeized among other things by his creditors, who thought to get a conſiderable ſum of mony for them of ſome Printer, ſo that the Academy could not recover what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd unto it, but by <hi>a Suit at Law,</hi> and a Decree <hi>du Chaſtelet</hi> of the 17th of <hi>May</hi> 1651. Preſently all were delivered into the hands of the Secretary of the Company, upon his demanding of them: but the Company Ordered there ſhould be a Copy of them taken to remain alwaies at the <hi>Lord Chancellors.</hi> They met twice a week to go on with the Dictionary, but to omit that, they were forced to go over again part of that which had been done at thoſe leſſer boards, it has hitherto advanced no farther then the Letter I: and this ſlowneſs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the uncertainty what fortune may befal the Academy hereafter, is enough
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115385:63"/>
to make it doubted whether it will ever be finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Many do very much wonder, that ſo many men, famous for their worth, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the greateſt things, as their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular worths do ſufficiently manifeſt, ſhould amuſe themſelves ſo long about a work, which ſeems to have nothing of Noble in it, and of which perhaps not one of them hopes to ſee an end.

But I ſhall be bold to ſay, that, if we look a little neerer into things, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and their conſtancy in the execution of it, deſerve nothing leſſe then high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations. I know very well, that in this I exceed the bounds of Hiſtory, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting it ſelf to make a faithfull relation, ought to leave the judgment to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and alwaies continue Neuter between contrary parties; but if I faile herein, you will pardon this fault I am confident, for the deſire which I have to let you know, what have been my thoughts many times concerning this buſineſſe, and to clear a truth, which ſeems not to me to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known. Firſt then, it will not be denyed me, I think, but that the Project of a <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and a <hi>Poëtick,</hi> which I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told you of, was moſt worthy of this
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115385:63"/>
Company. 'Twill alſo be granted me, I conceive that to do this, a <hi>Dictionary</hi> and a <hi>Grammer,</hi> are two things, either neceſſary or at leaſt very uſeful, according as I have above related. But, ſuppoſe theſe four works a <hi>Dictionary,</hi> a <hi>Grammer,</hi> a <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and a <hi>Poetick,</hi> ſhould be finiſht, I ſay not in 4 years, but even in 20 or 30, who is there that would not ſpeak of it to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Academie? Now if you will commend this deſign, and blame the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of its execution, you commend that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> properly belongs unto it, &amp; blame that which does not, &amp; ſo ought not to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it. For if the Cardinal that founded it, had had more care to put it forward, and had made this imployment the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and principal buſineſſe of all, or moſt, of the Academiciens; I do not doubt but theſe four works would have been printed long ago, and followed alſo with many others. And if in other things, as I alwaies ſay, true glory conſiſts in doing good ſervice to the Publick, in what manner ſoever it be; Such a <hi>Dictionary,</hi> whether you look upon', as a means to attain to <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> or conſider it barely in it ſelf, it cannot but make very much to the honour of its Authors. If any one that is big with high conceits ſhal here pretend, proudly to contemn this whole ſtudy of words and language, I ſhall not diſpure the caſe, but willingly ſuffer him to follow his own inclinations, and imploy himſelf
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115385:64"/>
wholly, either to the affairs of the world, or to more ſublime ſtudies; but let him beware leſt that purſuing, it may be, a falſe good, or entertaining <hi>Opinions for Verities,</hi> and <hi>Conjectures</hi> for <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> even when he thinks he applys himſelf wholy to <hi>ſolid</hi> matters, he embrace a <hi>cloud</hi> as well as others. I ſpeak now to them, who to thoſe knowledges that are indeed the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, do add alſo that of good literature, making it one of their greateſt pleaſures, who would be weary of the world, were it not for this delightful amuſement, who find in it wherewith to comfort themſelves in afflictions, and recreate themſelves in proſperity, whereby to entertain themſelves with their friends &amp; content themſelves in their privacies. In a word, wherewith to render themſelves fit for what ever the Publick, or a private ſociety can require of them. I make no queſtion but theſe men would receive the Academies Dictionary with joy, and prize it highly, and receive by it a wonderful benefit. What comfort muſt it needs be to thoſe that write, when in the heat of compoſing, they are perplext with ſome one of thoſe tedious &amp; irkſome ſcruples in the language, of thoſe petty <hi>remora's</hi> that on a ſudden arreſt the greateſt Veſſels in the main Sea, even when they go with full ſail: what comfort, I ſay, muſt it needs be to be delivered from them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to paſſe on to other things of more importance, and to have the Warrant of ſo famous a Company for what they ſhall
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115385:64"/>
write? I know well that the ſpirits of the <hi>French</hi> are not willing to be enſlav'd; nor would I deſire, to forbid ſuch as find in themſelves a certain particular Genius, from yeilding any thing to their own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, when it is not abſolutely extravagant, nor directly contrary to that of the Publick; but when all's done, in things of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, and which meerly depend upon inſtitution, the teſtimony of forty perſons the moſt underſtanding in ſuch matters, has very much weight and authority, and all men that are any thing rational, would, were it only for quietnes ſake, chooſe much rather to yield than to contend. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques</hi> of Monſieur <hi>de Vaugelas,</hi> may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with an example hereof; they were encountred by many, ſcarce any one but found ſomewhat or other in them, contrary to his own judgment: And yet 'tis well known, they do by little and little take with the wits, and daily gain credit amongſt them. This is but the work of one Academicien; if that of the Academie were publiſht, it would not only reſolve us an infinite number of doubts; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, 'tis very likely it would confirm and in ſome ſort ſix the Body of the Language, and hinder it, not from changing at all, (for that can never be hoped in any of the living Languages) but at leaſt from changing ſo often and ſo ſuddenly as it doth. All other Nations reproach ours with this inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Our eleganteſt and moſt polite Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, in a few years become barbarous,

'twould make one ſick to read the beſt and moſt ſolid of them, when they begin to grow old; and if ever we can be cured of the evil, in my opinion it muſt be only by this remedy. Nor muſt we paſſe by, as matter of no concernment, the advantage we ſhall reap by this Dictionary, to find at once the roots of all derivative words; a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious advice, whether they are <hi>low</hi> or <hi>high,</hi> proper for proſe or for verſe; in what kind of writing they may be uſed moſt apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an almoſt indubitable deciſion of the length or ſhortneſs of ſyllables, for pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and of é <hi>open</hi> or <hi>cloſe,</hi> which are the rocks that not only all <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> but even all that are not of the <hi>Iſle of France,</hi> do ſo rudely daſh againſt.

I ſhall go a little farther, and add, that though this Dictionary be never finiſht, ſince that after all, they have inceſſantly labour'd in it, who can doubt, but that this exerciſe of exactly conſidering words in their Original, of obſerving their ſeveral accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of remarquing all the phraſes that may be made of them, was moſt proper for a Body, that propounded to it ſelf the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment of the Language as its end; and moſt profitable to particular Academiciens

And in explaining the nature of this ſeverity 'twas ſaid that it ſhould have nothing of affectation or ſowreneſs, but only be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſolid, and judicious, that the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of works ſhould be done exactly by thoſe that ſhall be named Commiſſioners, and by the whole Company when it judges of their Obſervations.

THE FOURTH PART: Of Some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marquables that paſt in the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</head>
               <p>I WILL add now according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſome conſiderable paſſages that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the Academie, which I could not handſomely bring in any where elſe.</p>
               <p>That which offers its ſelf firſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of time, (which I obſerve as much as I can, in each Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) is the generoſitie which the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie expreſt after the death of <hi>Camuſat,</hi> its <hi>Stationer,</hi> having in favour of his wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and Children, oppoſed, as I may ſo ſay, the will of the Cardinall, its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector. Preſently after his death, <hi>Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur de Boiſrobert,</hi> who was then with the Cardinall at <hi>Abbeville,</hi> wrote to the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie, <hi>That his Eminence having heard the news, though he thought there was not any man in</hi> Paris, <hi>more capable to fill this place then</hi> Cramoiſy, <hi>his own</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, <hi>whom he eſteem'd and loved, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe would not make uſe of that Authority which he had, as their Head, to command them to receive him, but onely deſired, that he ſhould propound him to them, with this condition, that if they knew of any other, that would be fitter for them, they might take him, not deſiring in the leaſt manner, either in this or any thing elſe to violate their choice.</hi> By way of poſtſcript 'twas

added. <hi>Since the writing of my Letter, my Lord ſent for me before much noble Company, to tell me, that you would do him a kindneſſe to take the ſaid</hi> Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſy; <hi>I ſee plainely he is very earneſt in this buſineſſe, having done me the honour to ſpeak to me thrice about it.</hi> For all this <hi>Camuſat's Widdoe</hi> being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to continue her trade, and having with her for this purpoſe one <hi>du Cheſne,</hi> a kinſman of her Husbands, and a Scholar, who now is a Dr. in Phyſick; the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie deſired to continue that honour to her family, and anſwered <hi>M. de Boiſrobert</hi> in ſuch a manner, as not forgetting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which it owed the Cardinall, and ſubmitting it ſelf alwayes to obey his will, it let him plainely know, that it was but juſtice to do ſo. This Letter had the effect which was deſired,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg.

Thus after they had order'd an anſwer to <hi>M. de Boiſrobert,</hi> to thank him, and to deſire him alſo to preſent their moſt humble thanks to the Cardinall; <hi>du Cheſne</hi> was brought into the Aſſembly took the Oath in the name of the Widdoe, and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to imitate the diſcretion, care, and diligence of the deceaſed. And becauſe at the

death of <hi>Monſieur Bardin,</hi> 'twas reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that at the death of all thoſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there ſhould be performed a <hi>ſervice</hi> in <hi>les Carmes Reformes</hi> called <hi>des Billettes.</hi> It was ordered there ſhould be one alſo for <hi>Camuſat,</hi> &amp; this was the honour which this Company did to the memory of its Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. But concerning <hi>M. de Boiſrobert's</hi> Letter to the Academie, me thinks I ought not to forget this pretty Circumſtance. It was ſigned <hi>Voſtre tres-humble</hi> and <hi>tres-obeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Serviteur.</hi> The Academie that thought good to anſwer from the whole Body, to the end that the Letter might be the more effectuall in favour of the <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe,</hi> was ſomewhat at a ſtand what to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. On the one ſide the whole body wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to one of its Members, ought not in appearance to treat him as an equall, and on the other ſide meerly to ſay, <hi>de tres-affectioner ſerviteurs,</hi> according to the cuſtom, ſeemed not civil enough, and to be uſed onely to perſons very inferiour.

               </p>
               <p>I AM now to ſpeak of the death of another Perſon more conſiderable, which I know not how to paſſe by in ſilence, 'twas that of the Cardinal himſelf, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector &amp; Founder of this Body. Whether it were ill for the State, as I ever thought it was, this is no place to diſpute. But moſt

                     <hi>Reg. Dec.</hi> 9. 1642.</note> The ninth of the ſame month, the Company being mett, <hi>Monſieur de l'Eſtoille,</hi> who had been made <hi>Director</hi> eight dayes before, ſaid; <hi>That he thought there was not any one in the whole Body, but was moſt ſenſibly touched with this dyſaſter, and was ready to expreſſe it, not onely in ordaining a Service, and in compoſing an Elogie for the Cardinall, as they were wont to do for the Academiciens that dyed; but beſides in founding an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie for him, with the greateſt ſolemnity that was poſſible. That nevertheleſſe all this pomp reſpecting more the ſatisfaction of the living, then the glory of the dead, he thought that the Academie ought rather to give proof of its piety and gratitude, by ſome ſpeedy and zealous actions, then by any great preparations, which muſt needs be retarded a long time. That he therefore deſired the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to deliberate, what was to be done in this buſineſſe.</hi> Upon this propoſition it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved there ſhould be performed <hi>a Service</hi> for the <hi>Cardinal</hi> in the <hi>Carmes des Billettes,</hi> at the charge of the Company, every one contributing thereto what he pleaſed, to the end that the action might be done the more honourably, and with the greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: That <hi>Monſieur de la Chambre</hi> ſhould make an Elogie, for him M. <hi>de Seriſay</hi> an <hi>Epitaph,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur the Abbot of Ceriſy</hi> a <hi>Funerall Oration,</hi> that each of the other Academiciens ſhould compoſe ſomething
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115385:72"/>
in Verſe or Proſe in praiſe of him, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had already done, and <hi>Monſieur Baro</hi> amongſt others; <hi>a Sonnet</hi> of whoſe upon the Church <hi>de Sorbonne</hi> (where the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall choſe to be buryed) was then read: But as to the <hi>Funerall Oration;</hi> the votes were divided, in reſolving whether it ſhould be pronounced in publick, or no; and as I told you elſewhere, they referrd themſelves to the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> who thought good to have it pronounced onely in the Academie; which was done a while after. As for the <hi>Service,</hi> they judged afterwards, that 'twas fitteſt it ſhould be onely done decently and without pomp. <hi>Monſieur de l'Eſtiolle</hi> the <hi>Director,</hi> deſired that he might have leave to defray, the charge of it alone, which was granted him, and the <hi>Service</hi> was celebrated on the twentieth of the ſame Month at ten of the clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>But the thing of moſt importance for the Academie was, to chooſe a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector</hi> in the place of him, whom they had lately loſt: many inclined to <hi>Card.

On the Contrary all thoſe of the Academie that were dependants or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Chancellor, were paſſionately deſirous to gain Him this title, and no man ſeemed to have more right to it then He. At the very beginning of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie, when he deſired to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, they talked of making him Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector with the Cardinall; but they went no farther for fear of diſpleaſing that great <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who had already ſhown ſome tokens, of jealouſy thereupon. So that all the honour they did him then, was to ſet his name firſt in the Catalogue, and at a diſtance from the reſt, whom they ranked by lot. The Academie nevertheleſſe had him alwayes in a particular Veneration. They deputed ſome to go thank him for the honour he was pleaſed to do them to be one of them: and when from <hi>Lord Keeper of the Seales,</hi> he came to be <hi>Chancellor of France</hi> they wrote a Letter to him to Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their joy. They thought therefore they could not with reaſon caſt their eyes upon any but him, ſince that they were alwayes very ſenſible, that in the birth of the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demie, he expreſt ſo much affection to it: and that beſides being raiſed to the prime

dignity of the <hi>Robe,</hi> he was a lover of thoſe that make profeſſion of learning, &amp; favour'd them upon all occaſions. Theſe reaſons out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh'd all the others in the minds of the Academiciens, and in the ſame Aſſembly of <hi>Dec.</hi> 9. 'twas reſolv'd that the <hi>Officers</hi> with Monſieur <hi>de Prieſac, Chapelain,</hi> and <hi>de Seriſay,</hi> ſhould go and beſeech him to honour the Company with his Protection. The Officers who are ordinarily three, were then but two, for that <hi>Monſieur Conrart,</hi> perpetual <hi>Secretary,</hi> had been made <hi>Chancellor,</hi> theſe two charges being not inconſiſtent, as I told you. <hi>M. de l'Eſtoile,</hi> who was the <hi>Director</hi> ſpake for them all, the 17th of the ſame month.

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1650.</note> having publiſht in the year 1650. a Treatiſe of <hi>Incommenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quantities, with a Tranſlation of the tenth Book of Euclide,</hi> added thereto a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſcourſe to the Gentlemen of the <hi>French</hi> Academy, concerning a way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Sciences in <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe of the Body have often preſented to the Academy their works, before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the printing of them. For example,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg. Feb.</hi> 01. 1639.</note> I find that <hi>Febr.</hi> 21. 1639. Monſieur <hi>Giry</hi> preſented to them by <hi>Camuſat,</hi> his <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Orations of Symmachus and</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe concerning the Altar of Victory,</hi> for which <hi>Camuſat</hi> was charged to thank him.</p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Racan</hi> when he had compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his <hi>Holy Odes,</hi> which were publiſht laſt year 1651. ſent them to the Academy, to deſire their opinion of them, and writ to them that Letter which he has put before his Book. The Academy ſent him that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which he has there likewiſe printed, without asking their leave to do it, nor
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115385:76"/>
the Secretaries that writ it, which yet was not ill taken by either of them.</p>
               <p>But of all that has been written or addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Academy, there is nothing whoſe memory deſerves better to be preſerved, than the Letters of Monſieur <hi>de Boiſsat</hi> an Academicien, wherein he gives them an exact account, both of what happen'd to him at the houſe of the <hi>Duke de Leſdiguieres,</hi> who was then only <hi>Count de Sault</hi> &amp; of the <hi>Agreement</hi> that was made between them by the mediation of the <hi>Nobility of Dauphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> aſſembled in a Body.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant how delicate and tickliſh things of this nature are amongſt the <hi>French;</hi> and that there may be found, thoſe that will blame me for mentioning this in a work where I have no deſign to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the glory of the Academy, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of any particular member thereof. But I do not ſe why I ſhould ſuppreſs any remarkable occurrences, which I meet with in my ſubject, that may ſerve for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for a precedent in the like occaſions, which may one day perhaps be publiſhed quite otherwiſe then indeed they are, and where, all things conſideted, there is not now any thing that may be offenſive either to this Illuſtrious <hi>Company,</hi> which had no part in this difference, or to Monſieur <hi>de Boiſsat,</hi> a Gentleman, as every one knows, very honourable and deſerving.

                     <p>AS I give you an account of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of misfortune, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd unto me at the houſe of the Kings Leivtenant in <hi>Dauphiné;</hi> ſo I impart to you an Agreement yet more ſtrange, which
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115385:77"/>
the nobility of this Province endeavour'd for the ſpace of three moneths, and for which they aſſembled themſelves together more ſolemnly then they were wont to do upon other occaſions. This extraordinary means which Providence hath raiſed to put an end to a misfortune, which my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents would have rendred immortal, has been able to bring me back to quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though the opinions of my Maſter, my friends, and my kinſmen carried me thither; and though, having ſent no leſs then three Gentlemen to <hi>Grenoble,</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the way of Arms was impoſsible, through the care that is generally taken of the preſervation of the Grandees. The principal reaſons that have obliged me hereto, beſides the will of all my friends, you will ſoon know if you remember, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that a part is indebted and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny its ſelf to its whole, that the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity at firſt undertook the cauſe for me, and that afterwards deſiring the entire cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the buſineſs, thoſe that were my Enemies were both Party and Judge all at once; that a Body of a hundred on ſix ſcore Gentlemen, is a Warrant more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to my honour then a Prince. That I have as many cautions as there were heads then aſsembled; That moreover to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115385:77"/>
repair the honour of a private perſon, they might make new Laws in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſince that they are the very ſource of honour; That it is a thing unheard of, in the Kingdom of France, that there ſhould be ſuch high ſatisfaction made to a Gentleman. And laſtly, that he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them wholly, ſhould ſubmit himſelf unto them after a manner unknown to all Ages. See, Gentlemen, the motives which obliged me to vanquiſh my own reſiſtance, and reſign my will to that of your whole Province. To tell you now, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they have proceeded, this Copy, the Original whereof I have by me, will teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and ſhew unto you, That theſe true Gentlemen have had more regard to my innocence, and their own honour, then to all the Grandeurs of the earth. All I can add from my ſelf is, that for the ſpace of twelve daies, they met together morning and evening with invincible patience, and that all which paſſed there, is great, memorable, and without example. I hope, Gentlemen, that having known me always perfectly to revere your Body, and to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh above all things the honour which I have to be a member of it, you will be pleas'd that Monſieur <hi>de Seriſay</hi> may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with your judgments hereupon,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115385:78"/>
that if this affair do merit (as I make no queſtion it will) your approbation, I may receive a more perfect contentment, if it be poſſible, then that I which now have. This I beg of you with all the reſpect I owe you, and that you would believe me to be more then any perſon in the world,</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115385:78"/>
aſſembled on purpoſe, after they had known from them the ſubject of it; they gave judgment for the ſatisfaction both of the one, and of the other. That a Gentl man of the Aſſembly, accompany'd with a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of M. <hi>de Boiſſat's,</hi> ſhould go to the houſe of Madam the Counteſs of <hi>Sault</hi> to deliver to her in the preſence of thoſe that ſhe ſhall think fit to call in, the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Sieur <hi>de Boiſſat</hi> has made in the ſaid Aſsembly, <q>That he never had in his thoughts an intent to offend her, and that he did alwaies highly eſteem her for her birth, virtue, and all thoſe excellent qualities that are in her; and that, if he did but ſuſpect in the leaſt that he had ſo reproached and offended her, as ſhe believed, he would not only beg her pardon for it, but ſhould alſo think himſelf unworthy to obtain it, and ſhould not forgive himſelf.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After which, Monſieur the Court <hi>de Sault</hi> accompany'd with his Guards and Domeſticks, ſhall come into the place where the Nobility ſhall be aſsembled, when he knows that Monſieur <hi>de Boiſſat</hi> is ſent for thither, and ſhall ſay to him: <q>Sir, you know the cauſe that has made me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the wrong that hath been done you, which makes me hope you will the more
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115385:79"/>
eaſily grant me the pardon which I beg of you for it: Acknowledging that I was carryed to that exceſs with too much heat, having therein imployed my Guards, and that if you had had a ſword, you would have uſed it, as long as you had any life: For which I am extream ſorry, and wiſh that I had loſt ſome of my blood rather then this had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. I beſeech you to believe it, and that I take you for a Gentleman of worth and courage, which you have witneſſed upon all occaſions, and might have given proof of, by waies which would have been more ſatisfactory to you, had not the Nobility taken the pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the buſineſs. I will add to this a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond favour which I deſire of you, and ſhall account, if it be poſsible, a greater obligation; 'tis Sir, that you would grant the pardon which I beg of you for Monſieur <hi>de Vaucluſe,</hi> ſince that I know with how much ſubmiſsion he will wait upon you at your houſe, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie how ſorry we are, for your having been ſo outragiouſly abuſed. And that you may the better perceive how much it affects me; I bring thoſe by whom you received this injury, to ſubmit them to whatever the Nobility ſhall appoint,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115385:79"/>
and you can deſire for your ſatisfaction. I aſſure my ſelf that you rightly judge by what I have ſaid, and what I do, that you have reaſon to forget what has offended you. You will extreamly oblige me to be ſatisfyed with it, and to be my friend, as I deſire it of you with all my heart.</q>

But if the evil were great, it muſt be confeſt alſo, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which was brought thereto, is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and they think you could not have refuſed it, without doing wrong to your ſelf, and offending thoſe who provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it for you with ſo much wiſdom, and judgment. They believe then that you had reaſon to yield to the advice and prudence of thoſe Gentlemen, and that you could not have more ſure, nor more

In a word, Sir, they think a Gentleman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be treated more gloriouſly then you have been by all thoſe of your profeſsion, Who in this Agreement, appeared no leſs your Protectors then your Judges; and they do promiſe themſelves a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular advantage by it, namely, to ſee you here very ſhortly, where they will themſelves teſtifie to you, how much they praiſe God that this affair is ſo happily ended; but in the interim whileſt they expect you, they thought fit to give you this teſtimony, which you deſired, of their judgement, and affection, by the pen</p>

And indeed the Company having gladly received this Propoſition, the election was made eight dayes after by balls, which were all for him: and 'twas ordered, that the Academy ſhould go in a Body to thank the Chancellor for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he had done them, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed preſently, and received by him with extream civility.</p>
               <p>I have now told you all that have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Academy ſince its Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:115385:88"/>
which gave ſo good ſatisfaction, that it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged all that were received afterwards, to do the like. There are amongſt the Papers of the Academy thirteen of theſe gratulatory Orations, namely thoſe of Meſſieurs <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru, de Bezons, de Salomon, Corneille, Baleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, de Mezeray, de Montereul, Triſtan, Scudery, Doujat, Charpentier,</hi> the Abbot <hi>Taleman,</hi> and <hi>the Marqueſs of Coaſtin.</hi> But of this great number of Academiciens, not to ſpeak of the Chancellour who of an Academicien, is become Protector of the Company, whoſe Elogies ſhall be ſeen in Hiſtories more important, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous then this; ſeventeen are dead: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning each of whom I think it not amiſſe to ſpeak ſomewhat in particular. And if I ſhould follow mine own inclination, this part of my work would be exceſſive long; for I confeſs, I have an extream and inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able curioſity for every thing that can let me know the manners, Genius, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of extraordinary perſons; and that I am even guilty of ſo much weakneſs as to ſtudy many times in Books, the ſpirit of the Author far more then the matter which he treats of. But I will not forget that I write more for others, then for my ſelf, and that this is the Hiſtory of the Academy, and not of the Academiciens, of whom, to ſay the truth, I ought not to ſpeak any more then is neceſſary for you to judge of the whole Body by ſome of its members.

                     <p>THE French Academy thought of nothing but compoſing Songs of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, for his Majeſties victories, when it was forced to go into mourning and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the loſſe of PETER BARDIN, one of its moſt illuſtrious Ornaments. He was born in the year <hi>1590.</hi> in the chief City of Normandy, of Parents, that left him a more advantageous portion of the goods of the mind, than of thoſe of fortune. He received from them a life which he has loſt, and he returned them a glory which ſhall never he extinguiſhed. He took the firſt tincture of piety, and good letters amongſt the Fathers the Jeſuits. Even then his Maſters judged, he would prove a man more than ordinary: But as the fruits of the Autumn do many times ſurpaſse the promiſes of the Spring: ſo his actions and his writings taught them ſince, that they did not conceive hopes high enough of him. He would not ſtudy to become lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but to be more good, and he took leſſe care to enrich his memory, than to poliſh his reaſon, and regulate his manners. He was fit for all kind of Learning, but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115385:90"/>
he addicted himſelf particularly to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and the Mathematicks, with ſo good ſucceſs as kindled jealouſie in the moſt able. The love of ſoverain Truth caſting him upon the ſtudy of Divinity, he ſtopt not but at the clear and wholſome ſprings, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>om whence he drew thoſe beams which did enlighten and yet not dazle him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had collected much treaſure from Authors both ſacred and prophane; he believed he ſhould commit a piece of theft, if he were not liberal therewith. The firſt fruits of his pen were conſecrated to the glory of God by the Paraphraſe of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes</hi> which he compoſed and entitled PENSEES MORALES. In this work the dignity of the ſubject is maintained with an Elocution ſtrong without rudeneſs; rich, without ornament; curious and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, without affectation. It was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received with extraordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. Envie it ſelf ſpake not a ſyllable againſt him, or if it did, it was in ſecret. This encourag'd him to make another Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to poſterity, which was the firſt and ſecond parts of his LYCEE, in which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing an Honeſt man, he drew his own picture ere he was aware.

two and fortieth year of his age, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved poſterity of the fruits of his ſtudies. He had the conduct of Monſieur <hi>d'Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieres</hi> in his youth, and afterwards dwelt with him, to aſsiſt him with his Counſel in his moſt important affairs, which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced as his own. He gave a very good teſtimony that he loved him paſsionatly; for ſeeing him in danger to be drowned, be ran to his ſuccour, not conſidering that in ſuch encounters charity is commonly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. Fear of the danger wherein he ſaw a perſon that was ſo dear to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding him, he loſt both his ſtrength and breath; ſo that he was not able to reſiſt the impetuoſity of the waters, which turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the place where he was loſt, made a whirlepool in the midſt of one of the moſt calm, and gentle Rivers of the world. This misfortune would have diſquieted his friends for the ſtate of his ſoul, had not the integrity of his life aſſured them that he was alwaies prepared for death; there could not be a more lamentable kind of death, nor a more glorious cauſe. He was of a moſt ſweet converſation, and he knew ſo well to temper the ſeverity of his Vertue, that it was not offenſive to any one. Although his eſtate were leſſe then he deſerved, yet he thought it high
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115385:91"/>
enough, and to make it better, would not ſtoop to any of thoſe ſervile diligences which cuſtome has rendred almoſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Eight dayes before his death, he ſpake in the Academy, and his ſoul was elevated to ſo high a pitch, that one might judge from thence that he began to untack himſelf from matter, and that he drew nigh his Center. His ſtature was mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the colour of his hair and viſage ſhewed a juſt temperament of that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, which Philoſophers call wiſe and ingenious. The Academy did ſolemnly perform their devoirs to him, which Piety oblig'd them to, and 'twas a long time ere they could dry their tears. The regret which he begat even in thoſe that knew him not, was a conſolation to his friends; and the publick ſadneſs, was a remedy to their private grief. For a ſtately Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they preſerved the memory of his name in their ſouls, endeavouring to follow his example, and had no thoughts ſweeter then thoſe which repreſented to them his Vertue.</p>

Thou wanteſt nothing of him, but what is wanting of that Book; yet thou mayſt finiſh it, if thou knoweſt his life. Alas! he was taken away in the two and fourtyeth year of his age; I dare not ſay, unhappily, ſince it was with glory. Seeing his Benefactor ready to be drowned, he threw himſelf in, to help him. He dyed, and he for whom he was afraid, dyed not. The danger was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and the fear was mortall. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſurprizes thee, it did not ſurprize him. He was alwaies ready and his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death did onely ſhorten his griefs and haſten his felicity.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul Hay</hi> in <hi>Sieur du Chaſtelet,</hi> was of the ancient houſe of <hi>Hay</hi> in <hi>Bretagne;</hi> which glories that it ſprung ſix hundred yeares ago from that of the Earles of <hi>Carlile,</hi> one of the moſt illuſtrious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He was at firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate Generall to the Parliament of <hi>Rennes,</hi> and afterwards Counſellor of Eſtate in ordinary. He had likewiſe very honourable employment, at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115385:93"/>
to eſtabliſh the Parliament at <hi>Pau;</hi> and in the year 1635. the Intendance of juſtice in the Kings Army, where the late King, <hi>Louis</hi> 13. the Court of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and the Cardinall <hi>de Richelieu,</hi> were in perſon. He was nominated to be one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in the triall of the Marſhall <hi>de Marillae;</hi> but the Marſhall excepted againſt him, as his Capitall Enemie, and one that had made a Latin Satyr in riming proſe as well againſt him, as againſt his Brother the Lord Keeper of the Seales. It has bin reported of him ſince, that he denyed before the King, and that with an Oath, that he was the Author of that piece that yet afterwards when the ſame excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made againſt him another time, he owned what he had formerly denyed. Whereupon the King in choler cauſed him to be Clapt up. As for his own part, in the <hi>Obſervations</hi> which he had made <hi>upon the tryal of Marillac,</hi> he only proteſts, that he never made any Oath before the King, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying any thing more of that buſineſs. But I know very well what he has ſaid of it to his moſt familiar friends, and I have had very private memoires concerning it, which in a word may be reduced to this; that being deſirous to withdraw himſelf out of the number of the judges, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cauſed that Petition of the Marſhals excepting againſt him to be ſuggeſted, and that his artifice being diſcovered, by ſome potent perſons that were his Enemies,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:115385:94"/>
raiſed the Kings diſpleaſure. Moſt certain it is, that after the laſt petition of exception, which was preſented againſt him at <hi>Ruel,</hi> where the tryall was, he was committed by the King who was then at S. <hi>Germain,</hi> and carryed the ſame day to <hi>Villepreux:</hi> and that during his impriſonment, to make his peace at Court, he wrote thoſe <hi>Obervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> I ſpake of, which got him his Liberty. Afterwards he collected divers pieces of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Authors in defence of the King and his Officers, and printed them with this title. <hi>A Collection of pieces uſeful for a Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,</hi> and put before it that long Preface, which is as 'twere an Apology for the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>de Richelieu.</hi> He was a man of a good aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, of a hot Spirit, and very reſolute; he ſpoke and writ very well, and did infinitely love the excerciſes of the Academie. And 'tis ſaid they were not unprofitable to him, and that there appears a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe pieces he wrote before, and thoſe he wrote after the eſtabliſhment of this Body. 'Twas he that read, there, the firſt diſcourſe of the twenty, which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mention'd: I ſay, that read there; for through having gon through many Offices, and in particular that of advocate General, he was alwayes accuſtomed to ſpeak in publicke, he proteſted that never any Aſſembly appeared more awfull to him then this, and therefore he made uſe of the Liberty which the Statute gives to all the Academiciens, to read their Orations,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115385:94"/>
if they pleaſe, inſtead of ſpeaking them, I have heard ſome ſayings which are ſaid to be his, that me thinks deſerve to be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When Monſieur <hi>de Bouteville's</hi> triall was, he made a <hi>Factum</hi> for him, which was as eloquent as bold, and the Cardinall having objected to him, that it was to condemn the juſtice of the King, <hi>Pardon me,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>it is to juſtifie his mercy, if he be ſo good as to make uſe of it towards one of the valianteſt men in his Kingdom.</hi> One day, as he accompanyed Monſieur <hi>de Saint Preüil,</hi> who ſolicited the Duke of <hi>Montmorency's</hi> pardon, and expreſt much zeale for it, the King ſaid to him, <hi>I believe that Monſieur du Chaſtelet would have loſt an arme to ſave</hi> M. <hi>de Montmorency. I would Sir, have loſt them both; anſwer'd he, (for they are unable to do you ſervice,) and have ſaved one, that hath won you battaills, and might yet win you more.</hi> At his coming out of priſon, the Cardinall making ſome excuſe for his confinement, <hi>I make a great differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>between the evill your Eminence does, and that which it permits; and ſhall be never the leſſe obliged to ſerve you.</hi> And a little while after being carryed to the <hi>Kings Chappel,</hi> who did not look upon him, nay it ſeems did on purpoſe turn his head another way, as if out of a kind of ſhame, to ſee a man whom he had lately treated in that manner; He ſtept to Monſieur <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Simon,</hi> and ſaid to him, <hi>I beſeech you,</hi> Sir, <hi>tell the King I forgive him
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115385:95"/>
with all my heart, and do deſire he would do me the honour to look on me.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de</hi> S. <hi>Simon</hi> told the King, who laughed at it, and afterwards was very kind to him. He dyed being forty three years and five months old, <hi>April</hi> 6. 1636. of a quartan ague, and as I have heard ſome ſay, through the Phyſicians fault, and for having bin too much blooded. He left works both in Verſe and Proſe. That which I have ſeen in Verſe, is the <hi>Advice to the abſent,</hi> againſt thoſe that were then at <hi>Bruſſells</hi> with the Queen Mother, Mary de Medicis, and Monſieur, the Kings onely Brother; A pretty long Satyre, <hi>Againſt the Court-life,</hi> which begins, <hi>Sous un calme trompeur,</hi> &amp;c. which has bin falſly attributed to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophile;</hi> Another cruel and bloody Satyre, againſt a Magiſtrate, under the name of * * *.

His aſpect and converſation were cold and ſerious; but he had a high fancy, great courage, and ardent paſſions in ſo much, that I have bin aſſured, he was like to have dyed in good earneſt, for love of one of his Miſtreſſes. He was courteous, diſcreet and judicious, a perſon of honour and honeſty; and all that knew him, ſpeak of him as of a man not onely very amiable, but alſo worthy of a moſt particular eſteem. The onely work that he has in print, is, <hi>The Temple of death,</hi> which is one of the moſt handſomeſt pieces of our French Poetry.

And to this purpoſe I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I have often heard a friend of ours relate at large, how he cauſed <hi>The ſhepeard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes,</hi> a Paſtorall of Monſieur <hi>de Racan's</hi> who was his intimate friend, to be acted by perſons of qualitie, that he himſelf pickt out.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115385:98"/>
might ſee the very places that were preſented in little upon the Stage. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, which were of neceſſity to be in this play, to repreſent the Charms of a Magician, were contriv'd &amp; ordered with an extreme deal of care; And when a certain fiery dragon began to appear, one of the actors fell into a ſwoun, and moſt part of the Company trembled for fear leſt the fire (as it often happens in the like encounters,) ſhould exceed its Commiſſion. But the thing moſt to be admir'd at, was, that he had choſen all the Actors fit for the parts he gave them; and that almoſt all of them, having the ſame paſſions which they were to repreſent, or at leaſt being not far from them; they were as twere poſſeſt after an extraordinary manner. There was among the reſt, a young man that perſonated an afflicted Lover, and was himſelf an afflicted Lover, who upon this occaſion far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the <hi>Roſciuſſes, Aeſops,</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dories,</hi> and weeping himſelf firſt, made the whole aſſembly weep. This then was the life of this Academicien, which was not long: for he was ſcarce five and forty years old when he dyed. He left Children and many works of all ſorts.</p>

He was alſo Canon of <hi>Langres,</hi> and in his old age, finding himſelf no longer able to take pains by reaſon of his ſicklineſſe and particularly of an almoſt perpetuall want of ſleep, which he was troubled with, he retired himſelf to the Company of the <hi>Fathers of the Oratorie,</hi> but he would not be obliged to any of the duties, nor ſo much as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to call him <hi>Father.</hi> Yet he wore the ſame habit as the reſt did, onely he went alone with a ſecular ſervant. Whilſt he belong'd to one of the Colleges, he was impriſoned, for having made a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Satyre, intituled <hi>Indignatio Valeriana,</hi> againſt an Arreſt of Parlement, which had ſuppreſt a certain piece of money called <hi>Droit de landy,</hi> which Profeſſors took of their Scholars.

drew thither.

But he enjoy'd it not long, for he dyed very ſhortly after. I have heard him accuſ'd by many, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little too much addicted to money; and that although he had forty or fifty thouſand Livers of ready money, which they found in a Cheſt of his after his death, yet he ſeem'd to be afraid of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as poverty, which was cauſed perhaps, either from his old age, or from ſome conſiderable loſſes he had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. He was in his youth a great friend of <hi>Regnier.</hi> He is commended for an excellent memory, and 'tis ſaid among other things, that he could ſay almoſt by heart all <hi>Thuanus</hi> his Hiſtorie, and all the Elogies of <hi>Paulus Jovius.</hi> He was very courteous, a great approver of other mens works, in the preſence of the Authors; but ſometimes too, as I am told, a little pettiſh and omething too ſenſible of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, which he imagin'd had bin done him.

He was nominated at the firſt (as you ſaw before,) to be of the Academie. But the Cardinall <hi>de Richelieu</hi> never did any thing for him, and 'twas partly, as I have heard by ſome, becauſe he loved not to be askt for any thing, but that they ſhould leave him the glory, of giving of his own accord.

He loſt another ſon which was his eldeſt, and of whom he had great hopes. As for himſelf, he was a man of a good aſpect, ſuch almoſt as you ſee him in his picture before his Poems. To this purpoſe, Monſieur <hi>de Balzac</hi> ſaid of him.</p>

                  <p>His ſtature was none of the talleſt, and towards the end of his life he grew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what corpulent. He was of a pleaſant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in his Converſation, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily delighted with mirth and good chear: nevertheleſſe he was a perſon of honour, and a true friend. Beſides that <hi>French</hi> Poem which I mentioned, and ſome <hi>Latine</hi> ones not printed, there are two volums of his, one of verſes, which he ſet forth at his laſt going to the Court: the other of Letters, which an intimate friend of his publiſht after his death; and in my opinion, he never made them to have them printed. However we may ſay, they have done him no diſcredit; for there appears almoſt throughout, the purity of his wit, and that plain and familiar ſtyle which is proper to this kind of writing. But 'tis from his verſes he hath gotten his greateſt credit,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115385:105"/>
as he himſelf alſo acknowledged: &amp; truly it muſt needs be confeſt, that they have that facility clearneſs, elegancy, and a certain roundneſſe or ſmoothneſſe which few can imitate. Two things, if I be not deceiv'd, have been the principal cauſe hereof. Firſt, as he himſelf confeſſes, in the 17th of his Epiſtles, he affects to have his Verſes not tread upon the heels of one another; whence 'tis that you ſhall ſee very often 5 or 6 of them, every one having its perfect and compleat ſenſe in it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond place he obſerves every where in his expreſſions a ſimple, natural conſtruction, in which there is no tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition nor violence; ſo that, although he took incredible pains about it, one would think that all his words came into his mind by chance while he was writing, and that he could hardly have placed them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; though he would. I remember to this purpoſe, that one day when I went to ſee him. I found him hearing ſome verſes of his Son's, who read them to him. He came to a place where there was ſome word or other out of its natural place,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115385:105"/>
which made the ſenſe ſomewhat dubious for it might be refer'd both to that which follow'd, and to that which went before. But yet the ſenſe of the place took away the difficulty, and the paſſage was clear enough. He bid him read it to him three times, making as if he could not underſtand it, and at laſt turning to his Son: <hi>Ah Son,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>here you are not a right</hi> Maynard; <hi>for they do not uſe to place their words thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think it will not be amiſſe to relate alſo to this purpoſe three pretty paſſages, which ſpeake ſomewhat of him, and of his Genius for verſe, in the memoires which Monſieur <hi>de Racan</hi> has written of the life of <hi>Malherbe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He had</hi> (ſaith M. <hi>de Racan</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Malherbe) for his Shollars Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur</hi> Touvant, Colomby, Maynard, <hi>and</hi> de Racan; <hi>of whom he gave diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgments, and ſaid in general terms, that</hi> Touvant <hi>made verſes rarely well, without telling us wherein he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; That</hi> Colomby <hi>had an excellent wit, but that he had no Genius for Poetry; That</hi> Maynard <hi>made the beſt verſes, but that he wanted ſtrength; and that he gave himſelf to a kind of writing, which he was not fit for, meaning Epigrams; and that he never came cleanly off with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115385:106"/>
he had not ſting enough. And for</hi> Racan, <hi>that he had ſtrength, but did not take pains enough about his verſes; that moſt commonly to ſave a good conceit, he took too much licence; and that theſe two laſt, put together would make one excellent Poet</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another place: <hi>He ſtrove earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (he ſpeaks alwaies of <hi>Malherbe) wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At length alſo M.</hi> de Malherbe <hi>was weary of them, and there was only</hi> Maynard <hi>of all his Schollars that continued to make them as long as he lived.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I'le add one word to this paſſage, that 'tis true that <hi>Maynard</hi> not only made of theſe kind of Sonnets to his death; but that alſo in his latter years, wherein I was acquainted with him, he was altogether for them, and cryed out againſt the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that oppoſed them. And that he would be very angry when ſome to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his opinion alledged the example of M. <hi>Malherbe,</hi> ſaying, he wanted it not,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115385:106"/>
being ſtrong enough by reaſon and his own authority; and laſtly, that no man could hinder him from making Epigrams of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen verſes.</p>
                  <p>The laſt paſſage of the three, is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When M.</hi> de Malherbe <hi>came firſt to Court, which was in</hi> 1605. <hi>as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he did not as yet obſerve the making a pauſe at the third verſe in Stanza's of ſix, as may be ſeen in the prayer which he made for the King going to</hi> Limouſin, <hi>where there are two or three Stanza's in which the ſenſe is continued; and in the Pſalm</hi> Domine Dominus noſter, <hi>in this Stanza, and perhaps in ſome others, which</hi> I <hi>do not remember at preſent.</hi>

He dwelt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with the <hi>Duke of Orleans,</hi> then the Kings onely Brother, whom during the Broiles of this Kingdome being retired into <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he followed thither. From thence he was ſent by him into <hi>Spain,</hi> whence out of curioſity he paſſed in <hi>Africk,</hi> as may be ſeen in his <hi>Letters.</hi> He was highly eſteemed at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and 'twas there he made thoſe Spaniſh Verſes, which every body tool to be <hi>Lopez de Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga's:</hi> the phraſe and language of them was ſo pure.

much affection to him, and took pleaſure to diſcourſe with him very often. And he deſired him to write to him when he ſhould be returned into <hi>France,</hi> ſaying to him twice at his departure, <hi>no dexe V.

There were ſome other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of the Count Duke, prety remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and amongſt the reſt theſe two which I remember. Firſt that he brag'd to him in private, that in all the time he was in favour, he never gave any man an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive word. The other was, that he judg'd commonly of men very right, and rather by the ill, then by the good that was ſpoken of them, that is, if he ſaw they ſpoke but little ill of a man, or with but little certainty, he conceived a good opinion of him. I have ſeen alſo ſome fragments of a piece in proſe which <hi>Voiture</hi> being in <hi>France,</hi> intended to make in praiſe of this Miniſter of State, wherein he expreſt much of eſteem and veneration for him. He made two voyages to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was ſent to <hi>Florence</hi> to carry the news of the birth of K. <hi>Lewis</hi> 14. that now reignes. He had divers offices at Court, as <hi>Maſter of the Hoſtel to the King</hi> &amp; <hi>Introductor of Embaſſadors to the Duke of Orleans.</hi> He had alſo many pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: and received divers favours from

He was never married, and left onely a naturall Daughter. He dyed at

His Proſe is more correct and exact, it has a certain Air of gallantry, which is not found any where elſe, and ſomething ſo naturall and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act both together, that the reading thereof is infinitely taking. His Verſes perhaps are no leſſe curious, although more neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He many times ſlighted <hi>Rules,</hi> but like a <hi>Maſter,</hi> as a man that thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf far above them, and that ſcorned to bind himſelf to obſerve them. That which is moſt to be commended in all his writings is, that they are not <hi>Copies</hi> but <hi>Originals;</hi> and that by reading the ancients

and the moderns, <hi>Cicero, Terence, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſto, Marot,</hi> and many others: he made a certain new Character wherein he imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no man, and ſcarce any man can imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him. He had written the beginning of a Romance in proſe, which he called <hi>Alcidalis,</hi> the ſubject whereof was given him by <hi>Madame the Marques of Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur,</hi> who was then <hi>Mademoiſelle de Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouïllet, Julie d'Angenes.</hi> But ſince his death, this beginning having fallen into the hands of this Lady, was never ſeen, and perhaps never ſhall. To conclude, 'twas he that brought again into the faſhion in our age, the <hi>Rondeaux</hi> or ſonnets that end as they begin, which have bin quite out of uſe ever ſince <hi>Marot's</hi> time. I have amongſt my papers one thing which juſtifies what I now ſaid.

The <hi>Abbot of</hi> S. <hi>Germain,</hi> who was the writer one the adverſe part, treats him extreme ill in the Tract which he called <hi>The Chimerique Embaſſadour.</hi> He made an anſwer to it which is in the Collection of Monſieur <hi>du Chaſtelet.</hi> The Abbot <hi>of</hi> S. <hi>Germain</hi> replyed, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him yet more injuriouſly, whereby he was obliged to write again in his own defence. But Card. <hi>de Richelieu</hi> and King <hi>Lewis</hi> 13. dyed in the interim, and he could never obtain under the Regency a priviledge to print this Book. Hereat he was very much troubled, and ſeeing beſides that his Enemie was upon his return to Court, and that favour would be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on his ſide, he retired into <hi>Auvergne,</hi> where he dyed, being about threeſcore

in following his Maſter, and other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, made him dye poor, ſo that his eſtate was not ſufficient to ſatisfie his Creditors. He dyed aged about 65. yeares of an <hi>Impoſthume in the Stomack,</hi> which was many years growing upon him, and often times brought upon him a paine in his ſide, which they attributed to the ſpleen. At laſt in the year 1649. having bin extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily afflicted with this grief for the ſpace of five or ſix weeks, he found ſome eaſe, and believing he was almoſt cured, he would needs walk abroad to take the Ayre in the Garden of the <hi>Hoſtel de Soiffons</hi> where he had lodgings. But the next Morning his paine took him again with more violence. Of two ſervants which he had, he ſent him that was at hand, to call for help; but before he returned, the other coming in, found that he had vomited up the Impoſthume, and all in amazement asking him how he did, <hi>You ſee, my friend,</hi> (replyde he coldly and without motion) <hi>what a poor thing man is.</hi> After theſe words he ſpake no more, and lived but ſome few minutes. He was a comely man, well made in body and minde, of a good ſtature; his eyes and hair were black, his viſage full, and well-coloured. He was very devout, civil, and reſpectfull even to exceſſe; particularly towards La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, for whom he had an extreme vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He alwayes fear'd to offend any one, and upon this account, he ſcarce ever
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115385:115"/>
durſt take part in any controverſies or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. He was very frequent at <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouillet Hoſtel.</hi> His moſt intimate friends were M. <hi>Faret</hi> (who had bin as 'twere his Scholar,) M. <hi>de Chaudebonne,</hi> M. <hi>Voiture,</hi> and, towards his latter end, M. <hi>Chapelain,</hi> and M. <hi>Conrart.</hi> But above all he had contracted a moſt ſtrict acquaintance with the <hi>Baron de Foras,</hi> who is ſtill alive, and did alſo, as well as he, belong to the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> They called Brothers, and were companions in their devotions, in which, as in their friendſhip, they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered conſtantly. From his childhood he had very much ſtudied the French Tongue. He chiefly imitated Monſieur <hi>Coeffetedu</hi> and had ſo great an eſteeme of his writings, and above all of his <hi>Hiſtorie of Rome,</hi> that he could ſcarce allow of any phraſe or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was not uſed there. To this purpoſe Monſieur <hi>de Balzac</hi> ſaid, <hi>That in the judgment, of Monſieur de Vaugelas there was no ſalvation out of the Hiſtorie of Rome, no more then out of the Church of Rome.</hi> His chief excellency was for Proſe.

He had a preſent wit, and made many times very excellent replyes ſuch as that I ſpake of before, which he made to Cardinall <hi>Richelieu.</hi> He left behind him but two works conſiderable, one whereof is printed, the other not yet, when I wrote this. The firſt is his Book of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marques on the French Tongue,</hi> againſt which Monſieur <hi>de la Mothe le Vayer</hi> has made ſome obſervations, and it has ſince bin written, againſt by <hi>le Sieur Dupleix:</hi> but in the publick opinion it merits a moſt particular eſteem. For not onely the matter of it, is very good for the moſt part and the ſtyle excellent and admirable; but beſides, there is in the whole Body of the work, ſomething of an honeſt man, ſo much ingenuitie, and ſo much freedom, that one can ſcarce chooſe but love the Author of it. And I would to God that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moires which he had long ſince ready to make a ſecond Volume, could be found; and that we had not cauſe to bewail the loſſe of them which happened after his death, in the hands of thoſe that ſeiz'd upon his papers. The other Conſiderable work and as yet unprinted, is <hi>The Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Quintus Curtius,</hi> upon which he had bin thirty years, changing and correcting it continually. Nay they ſay that after he had ſeen ſome Tranſlations of M. <hi>d'Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,</hi> he was ſo taken with the Style of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115385:117"/>
them, (which is a little leſſe diffuſe then his own) that he began afreſh all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and made quite a new tranſlatior. I have ſeen the ſheets which remain of this laſt ſort, where for the moſt part, every period is tranſlated in the margin five or ſix ſeverall wayes, almoſt all of them very good. Monſieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Conrart,</hi> who take the paines to review this work with all exactneſſe, to print it, are many times hard put to it to judge which is beſt. And, which I count moſt remarkable, commonly that which be ſet down firſt, is that which they like beſt. This is the piece of which Monſieur <hi>Balzac</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Alexander of Quintus Curtius is invincible, and that of Vaugelas is inimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Voiture</hi> who was much his friend, uſed to jeare him for that exceſſe of pains and time which he beſtowed on it.

'Twas a certain pouder, very rare, which being caſt on the paper, made that which was before hand written there with a white Liquor, to appear; which, without that, was wholly imperceptible.

               <p>THUS I have related to you the birth, eſtabliſhment, and progreſſe of the <hi>French Academy</hi> to this preſent time. You do not expect I ſhould proceed any farther, and imitate that excellent Hiſtorian, who judging of the future from the knowledge of what was paſt, has ſo well made the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope of the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome.</hi> The fortune of the Academy 'tis very likely will follow that of the State: and be good or bad according to the Kings and grand Miniſters which it ſhall pleaſe God to give us. It is impoſſible to foreſee all that may happen from <hi>without,</hi> for its deſtruction or for its glory: but I'le tell you betwixt you &amp; me, that if there be any thing from <hi>within</hi> whereby it may fail, it is perhaps a certain Cuſtome or unwritten Law, which it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves more exactly then any of its Statutes. For I beſeech you, do you not think that the advantage of getting into this Body, muſt needs be look'd upon as a reward to all the Pens of <hi>France,</hi> and to all thoſe that find in themſelves any Genius extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? If theſe Gentlemen, when they are to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115385:132"/>
chooſe themſelves a Collegue, were bound alwaies to name the moſt worthy, whoever he be, be confident none would refuſe this honour, or if any one ſhould be ſo mad, all the ſhame and diſcredit would fall upon himſelf. Nevertheleſſe they preſerve invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably this Maxime, not to admit any man of what merit otherwiſe ſoever he be, that does not ask it. I know very well, what may be ſaid in favour of this Order, and make no queſtion but thoſe who were the firſt Authors of it, did it then upon very conſiderable grounds: but I doubt much whether the evil that it may produce now a dayes, be not greater then the good which may be expected from it. For, if I may ſpeak my mind freely, there proceeds from it one thing of moſt dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. That ſcarce any one Petitions to be admitted, who before he propounds it in publick, does not make ſure to himſelf ſuffrages in private, where common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hardly ſuffers one to deny the requeſt of a friend. I am well ſatisfied that all vacant places hitherto have been fitted as well as a man could wiſh; Nay, I ſee ſome amongſt the laſt comers, which this Company reckons amongſt her prime and greateſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments. But who ſhall aſſure us that it will be ſo hereafter, and who knows not that corruption creeps every day, &amp; too faſt, into all humane Inſtitutions, even when nothing has ben forgot that may keep it out? Thoſe that will be leaſt capable of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115385:132"/>
this employment will be perhaps moſt eager to look after it, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it eaſily, in a Countrey &amp; Age where men know not how to deny any thing but what reſpects mony and private intereſt. On the contrary many others whom the Academy ought to deſire for its members, will keep themſelves out of the way through natural modeſty, or that honeſt pride which ordinarily accompanies vertue and merit. 'Twill be anſwer'd perhaps, that they are not ſuch, becauſe they do not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves for it. Poſterity will not admit of this excuſe: and if it ſees ſmall or mean Actions appear upon the Stage, whilſt others, that were ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to have acted the chief parts, continue hid behind; it will without doubt blame the judgment that ſhall have made ſo ill a choice.</p>
               <p>But if this Company ſubſiſt long, and with the ſame honour it has done hitherto, although it produce not thoſe works which are expected from it, yet 'tis impoſſible, but that <hi>France</hi> ſhould receive much advantage by it.</p>
               <p>So many men of parts and learning can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meet together every week, without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up one another to induſtry and the ſtudy of good Letters, without reaping much profit from theſe converſations, and without ſpreading inſenſibly the profit they ſhall have gained to themſelves, over all <hi>Paris,</hi> and over all the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:115385:133"/>For my part, ſuch as I am; I profeſs and acknowledge that from my childhood, I have formed my ſelf, either by the writings or converſation of ſome of this Society, which have been my chief Maſters. What you find moſt tolerable in the Style, and in the manner of this work, you owe it to the Academy. But if the Academy it ſelf be not diſpleaſed, that I have taken upon me this employment, it ſhall know that it is endebted for it to you, and that, had it not been for our friendſhip, and your laudable curioſity, I had never written its Hiſtory.</p>

the thing it ſelf might forbid you to beſtow it upon me.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral conſiderations are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent before me. There's not one of them but does arreſt me, but does ſenſibly affect me, but does raiſe in me towards you, Gentlemen, ſome particular motion of gratitude.</p>
               <p>Shall I begin with the glory which is heaped on me by ſo rare a favour? Kings &amp; Conquerors, and even ſome of thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes of whom the Ancients made their gods, have ſometimes taken it for a great honour, to be made Burgeſſes of certain Common-wealths. And yet, Gentlemen, if we conſider, as we ought, a State never ſo flouriſhing, and as illuſtrious as 'tis poſſible; what is it elſe but a maſſe of people, whom only intereſt and neceſſity joyn together; where things are carryed ſometimes by riches, ſometimes by force and violence, ſometimes by cheating and couzening, and very rarely by vertue and merit? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if we be not dazled with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp, and judge more by the eye then by reaſon; as much as wiſdom is above the multitude, the ſoul above the body, and the deſire of knowledge above that of living: ſo much is the Academy above the Common-wealth, ſo much does the honour which you have done me, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe that which heretofore thoſe Kings, and thoſe Conquerours, and even thoſe very gods of Antiquity, gloryed in.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115385:135"/>
And when from theſe general reflections I deſcend to thoſe that are more particular, when I caſt my eyes upon this famous So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, eſtabliſht in the chiefeſt City of the chiefeſt Kingdom in the world, founded by the greateſt Stateſman that ever was, and protected even at this day by another, who, in a word, is moſt worthy to ſucceed him; when I look upon it, compoſed of ſo many excellent men, known, eſteemed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired of all <hi>Europe:</hi> When I conſider that for the future, I ſhall have a place amongſt them, that I ſhall ſee my name in the midſt of theirs, carryed through the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and partake of thoſe immortal praiſes which are due unto them: ſhall I be bold to ſay it, Gentlemen? I queſtion whether I am awake or aſleep, and whether this be not one of thoſe pleaſant dreams, which without taking us from the earth, make us believe we are in Heaven.</p>
               <p>But Gentlemen, thoſe pleaſant dreams leave nothing behind them, whereas the glory to which you call me, muſt ſoon be followed by a ſolid and real advantage. To what purpoſe ſhould I diſſemble it? If from my infancy good Letters have been my delight, if I have alwaies looked upon the Art of writing well, as the end and ſcope of all my endeavours; It was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eaſie nor poſſible for me to attain it, but by the favour which you do me. There is indeed a ſmall number of extraordinary
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115385:135"/>
perſons whom Nature took pleaſure in forming, who find all things in themſelves, who know what they were never taught, who follow no rules, but make and give them to others. Such are you in our dayes, Gentlemen: Such in former Ages were ſome great Perſonages of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens.</hi> But as for us that are of an inferior rank, if we have only our own ſtrength, and if we borrow nothing from others; which way ſhould we, with one only judgement and one only wit, and that too, but ordinary and mean, content ſo many different wits, ſo many ſeveral judgments, to which we expoſe our writings? Which way ſhould we of our ſelves get together ſo many qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, whoſe principles ſeem contrary? That our writings ſhould be at the ſame time ſubtile and ſolid, ſtrong and delicate, profound and polite. That we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies joyn together Art and Nature, ſweetneſs and majeſty, perſpicuity and brevity, liberty and exactneſs, boldneſs and modeſty, nay ſometimes even madneſs and reaſon? 'Tis very much if our birth gives us a part of that which is neceſſary for theſe great things, we muſt receive all the reſt from our breeding; we muſt have recourſe to precepts, examples, friends and maſters; and theſe precepts, theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, theſe friends, theſe maſters, 'tis amongſt you Gentlemen that I look to find them. What ſhall I ſay now of the ſweetneſs which I fancy to my ſelf of your
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115385:136"/>
Conferences? Thoſe whom you admit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them may perhaps expreſſe in ſome ſort both the honour and the profit which they expect thence; but as for that pleaſure, which doubtleſs the ſweet commerce of good things affords you, that pleaſure, which vertue joyned to friendſhip, which the union of ſpirits, and the conformity of laudable deſires, do infuſe into all your converſations, one muſt, if I be not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, taſt it for to comprehend it; it is felt &amp; cannot be expreſt. I call to witneſs your ſelves, Gentlemen, I call to witneſs theſe hours which ſlide away ſo faſt, and that importune darkneſs, which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly comes ſooner then you deſire, to part you, and to break up theſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
               <p>But I dwell too long, Gentlemen, on that which is leaſt peculiar in your benefit. It would have been my duty to have than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked you thus, if you had granted this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to my merit, to my earneſt ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the neceſſity of filling your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and obeying your Statutes. But now that you ſhut your eys upon all my defects, that you prevent both my endeavours and my hopes, that for me you forget your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms and your Lawes, that ther's no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle ſo great, but your goodneſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts it; With what words, with what eloquence, although 'twere even your own, can I ſufficiently thank you? I will not here examine thoſe defects, which you
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115385:136"/>
have been pleaſed not to conſider, and which ſhould have hindred you from ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting your thoughts on me; and I would to God I could either wholly amend them, or hide them from you as long as I live. But I know not how to be ſilent of this exceſſe, this profuſeneſs of your favours, this manner of obliging me, contrary to all precedents. I am afraid, Gentlemen, I ſpeak too boldly of it; you have done, methinks, in this action, both more then you ought, and more then you could; you have in ſome ſort, preferred my glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your own, the intereſt of a private perſon without deſert, before that of all your moſt noble Body, I thought, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; and perhaps you thought ſo too, that this ſhould have been the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal matter of my Diſcourſe: But how can I enlarge any farther on a ſubject, where if I would commend your bounty, I ſee my ſelf almoſt conſtrained to blame your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, where all my thanks would be reproaches, where I can neither defend you without pride, nor accuſe you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ingratitude? Of a truth if the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my never did ſo much honour to any man, never had any man ſo firm and ſo true a deſign to honour it; if for my ſake it has violated its own Laws, it ſhall never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that I violate them. But yet I fear that all my good reſolutions cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe hers. What am I, Gentlemen, that in favour of me thoſe foundations ſhould

be ſhaken which were laid with ſo much judgement, and ſtrengthned by the practice of ſo many years? What am I that to give me entrance into this ſacred place, it ſhould be neceſſary, not to open the gates thereof; but, if I may be bold to ſay it, to beat down the ramparts, and the walls, as they are wont to do for a triumphant vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious King. I ſhall be carried away with vanity if I proceed any farther. I feel that ſweet confuſion thoughts, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from joy and gratitude, and all thoſe other delightful paſſions when they are at the higheſt pitch: and in this diſorder of my ſoul; all I can do is to reſume my own words, to make an end juſt as I began, and to ſhut up all with this concluſion: If you expected from me thanks that ſhould have been anſwerable to the greatneſs of your benefit, or to the dignity of this Aſſembly; I make no queſtion but you have already repented you of all the favours you have done me: But if to deſerve them be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but perfectly to underſtand the value of them, never man deſerved them better then I, and you never made a more judicious election.</p>
